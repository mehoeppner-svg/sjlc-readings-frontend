<p class="starts-chapter" id="p01029001_06-1"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01029001-1">29 </b>Then Jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the people of the east. <b class="verse-num" id="v01029002-1">2 </b>As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep lying beside it, for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well’s mouth was large, <b class="verse-num" id="v01029003-1">3 </b>and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well.</p>
<p id="p01029003_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01029004-1">4 </b>Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where do you come from?” They said, “We are from Haran.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029005-1">5 </b>He said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029006-1">6 </b>He said to them, “Is it well with him?” They said, “It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029007-1">7 </b>He said, “Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep and go, pasture them.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029008-1">8 </b>But they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.”</p>
<p id="p01029008_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01029009-1">9 </b>While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. <b class="verse-num" id="v01029010-1">10 </b>Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.</p>
