I will devote them to destruction, and make them a horror, a hissing, and an everlasting desolation. <b class="verse-num" id="v24025010-1">10&nbsp;</b>Moreover, I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the grinding of the millstones and the light of the lamp. <b class="verse-num" id="v24025011-1">11&nbsp;</b>This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. <b class="verse-num" id="v24025012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, declares the LORD, making the land an everlasting waste. <b class="verse-num" id="v24025013-1">13&nbsp;</b>I will bring upon that land all the words that I have uttered against it, everything written in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations. <b class="verse-num" id="v24025014-1">14&nbsp;</b>For many nations and great kings shall make slaves even of them, and I will recompense them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.”</p>
