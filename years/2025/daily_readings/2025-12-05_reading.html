<p id="p15001001_05-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v15001001-1">1&nbsp;</b>In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing:</p>
<p id="p15001001_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v15001002-1">2&nbsp;</b>“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. <b class="verse-num" id="v15001003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Whoever is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of the LORD, the God of Israel—he is the God who is in Jerusalem. <b class="verse-num" id="v15001004-1">4&nbsp;</b>And let each survivor, in whatever place he sojourns, be assisted by the men of his place with silver and gold, with goods and with beasts, besides freewill offerings for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p id="p15001004_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v15001005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Then rose up the heads of the fathers’ houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, everyone whose spirit God had stirred to go up to rebuild the house of the LORD that is in Jerusalem. <b class="verse-num" id="v15001006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And all who were about them aided them with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with beasts, and with costly wares, besides all that was freely offered. <b class="verse-num" id="v15001007-1">7&nbsp;</b>Cyrus the king also brought out the vessels of the house of the LORD that Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods. <b class="verse-num" id="v15001008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Cyrus king of Persia brought these out in the charge of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah. <b class="verse-num" id="v15001009-1">9&nbsp;</b>And this was the number of them: 30 basins of gold, 1,000 basins of silver, 29 censers, <b class="verse-num" id="v15001010-1">10&nbsp;</b>30 bowls of gold, 410 bowls of silver, and 1,000 other vessels; <b class="verse-num" id="v15001011-1">11&nbsp;</b>all the vessels of gold and of silver were 5,400.

<p id="p62004001_04-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v62004001-1">4&nbsp;</b>Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. <b class="verse-num" id="v62004002-1">2&nbsp;</b>By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, <b class="verse-num" id="v62004003-1">3&nbsp;</b>and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. <b class="verse-num" id="v62004004-1">4&nbsp;</b>Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. <b class="verse-num" id="v62004005-1">5&nbsp;</b>They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them. <b class="verse-num" id="v62004006-1">6&nbsp;</b>We are from God.

<p id="p62004012_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v62004013-1">13&nbsp;</b>By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. <b class="verse-num" id="v62004014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. <b class="verse-num" id="v62004015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. <b class="verse-num" id="v62004016-1">16&nbsp;</b>So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. <b class="verse-num" id="v62004017-1">17&nbsp;</b>By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world. <b class="verse-num" id="v62004018-1">18&nbsp;</b>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear.
