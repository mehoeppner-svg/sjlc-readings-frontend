<p id="p01027001_04-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01027001-1">27&nbsp;</b>When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son and said to him, “My son”; and he answered, “Here I am.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027002-1">2&nbsp;</b>He said, “Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me, <b class="verse-num" id="v01027004-1">4&nbsp;</b>and prepare for me delicious food, such as I love, and bring it to me so that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die.”</p>
<p id="p01027004_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it, <b class="verse-num" id="v01027006-1">6&nbsp;</b>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, <b class="verse-num" id="v01027007-1">7&nbsp;</b>‘Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD before I die.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v01027008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027010-1">10&nbsp;</b>And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027011-1">11&nbsp;</b>But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027013-1">13&nbsp;</b>His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.”</p>
<p id="p01027013_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027014-1">14&nbsp;</b>So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</p>
<p id="p01027017_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027018-1">18&nbsp;</b>So he went in to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027019-1">19&nbsp;</b>Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027020-1">20&nbsp;</b>But Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” He answered, “Because the LORD your God granted me success.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027022-1">22&nbsp;</b>So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027023-1">23&nbsp;</b>And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands. So he blessed him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027024-1">24&nbsp;</b>He said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He answered, “I am.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027025-1">25&nbsp;</b>Then he said, “Bring it near to me, that I may eat of my son’s game and bless you.” So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.</p>
<p id="p01027025_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027026-1">26&nbsp;</b>Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near and kiss me, my son.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027027-1">27&nbsp;</b>So he came near and kissed him. And Isaac smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him and said,</p>
