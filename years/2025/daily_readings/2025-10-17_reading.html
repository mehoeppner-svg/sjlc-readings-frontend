These were allies of Abram. <b class="verse-num" id="v01014014-1">14 </b>When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. <b class="verse-num" id="v01014015-1">15 </b>And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus. <b class="verse-num" id="v01014016-1">16 </b>Then he brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot with his possessions, and the women and the people.</p>
