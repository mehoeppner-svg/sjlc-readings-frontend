<p id="p01027030_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027030-1">30 </b>As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027031-1">31 </b>He also prepared delicious food and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son’s game, that you may bless me.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027032-1">32 </b>His father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027033-1">33 </b>Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, “Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027034-1">34 </b>As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, O my father!” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027035-1">35 </b>But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027036-1">36 </b>Esau said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob?<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title='&lt;note class="explanation" sub-class="name-meaning"&gt;&lt;i class="catch-word"&gt;Jacob&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;He takes by the heel&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;He cheats&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>1</a></sup> For he has cheated me these two times. He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.” Then he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027037-1">37 </b>Isaac answered and said to Esau, “Behold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027038-1">38 </b>Esau said to his father, “Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.</p>
<p id="p01027038_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027039-1">39 </b>Then Isaac his father answered and said to him:</p>

</p><p id="p01027040_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027041-1">41 </b>Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027042-1">42 </b>But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027043-1">43 </b>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran <b class="verse-num" id="v01027044-1">44 </b>and stay with him a while, until your brother’s fury turns away—<b class="verse-num" id="v01027045-1">45 </b>until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him.

<p id="p01027045_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027046-1">46 </b>Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I loathe my life because of the Hittite women.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title='&lt;note class="translation" sub-class="original"&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;daughters of Heth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>4</a></sup> If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?”</p>
