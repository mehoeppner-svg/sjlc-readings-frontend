And he said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son’s game, that you may bless me.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027032-1">32&nbsp;</b>His father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027033-1">33&nbsp;</b>Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, “Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027034-1">34&nbsp;</b>As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, O my father!” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027035-1">35&nbsp;</b>But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027036-1">36&nbsp;</b>Esau said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob?<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Jacob&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;He takes by the heel&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;He cheats&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> For he has cheated me these two times. He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.” Then he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027037-1">37&nbsp;</b>Isaac answered and said to Esau, “Behold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027038-1">38&nbsp;</b>Esau said to his father, “Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.</p>
<p id="p01027038_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027039-1">39&nbsp;</b>Then Isaac his father answered and said to him:</p>

So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027043-1">43&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran <b class="verse-num" id="v01027044-1">44&nbsp;</b>and stay with him a while, until your brother’s fury turns away—<b class="verse-num" id="v01027045-1">45&nbsp;</b>until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?”</p>
<p id="p01027045_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027046-1">46&nbsp;</b>Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I loathe my life because of the Hittite women.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;daughters of Heth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?”</p>
