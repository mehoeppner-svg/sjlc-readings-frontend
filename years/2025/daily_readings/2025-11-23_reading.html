They did not walk in my statutes but rejected my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live; and my Sabbaths they greatly profaned.</p>
<p id="p26020013_04-1">“Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make a full end of them. <b class="verse-num" id="v26020014-1">14&nbsp;</b>But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out. <b class="verse-num" id="v26020015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Moreover, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands, <b class="verse-num" id="v26020016-1">16&nbsp;</b>because they rejected my rules and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols. <b class="verse-num" id="v26020017-1">17&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or make a full end of them in the wilderness.</p>
