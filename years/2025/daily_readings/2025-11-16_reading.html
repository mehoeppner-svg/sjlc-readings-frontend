<p id="p26003003_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v26003004-1">4&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with my words to them. <b class="verse-num" id="v26003005-1">5&nbsp;</b>For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and a hard language, but to the house of Israel—<b class="verse-num" id="v26003006-1">6&nbsp;</b>not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you. <b class="verse-num" id="v26003007-1">7&nbsp;</b>But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart. <b class="verse-num" id="v26003008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. <b class="verse-num" id="v26003009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Like emery harder than flint have I made your forehead. Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.” <b class="verse-num" id="v26003010-1">10&nbsp;</b>Moreover, he said to me, “Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears. <b class="verse-num" id="v26003011-1">11&nbsp;</b>And go to the exiles, to your people, and speak to them and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD,’ whether they hear or refuse to hear.”</p>
