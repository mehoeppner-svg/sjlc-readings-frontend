<h3 id="p10010001_01-1">David Defeats Ammon and Syria</h3>
<p id="p10010001_06-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v10010001-1">10&nbsp;</b>After this the king of the Ammonites died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place. <b class="verse-num" id="v10010002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And David said, “I will deal loyally<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;kindly&lt;/i&gt;; twice in this verse&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> with Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father dealt loyally with me.” So David sent by his servants to console him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the Ammonites. <b class="verse-num" id="v10010003-1">3&nbsp;</b>But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Has not David sent his servants to you to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it?” <b class="verse-num" id="v10010004-1">4&nbsp;</b>So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved off half the beard of each and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away. <b class="verse-num" id="v10010005-1">5&nbsp;</b>When it was told David, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return.”</p>
<p id="p10010005_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10010006-1">6&nbsp;</b>When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, the Ammonites sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, 20,000 foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of Tob, 12,000 men. <b class="verse-num" id="v10010007-1">7&nbsp;</b>And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the host of the mighty men. <b class="verse-num" id="v10010008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the gate, and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.</p>
<p id="p10010008_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10010009-1">9&nbsp;</b>When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians. <b class="verse-num" id="v10010010-1">10&nbsp;</b>The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and he arrayed them against the Ammonites. <b class="verse-num" id="v10010011-1">11&nbsp;</b>And he said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come and help you. <b class="verse-num" id="v10010012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Be of good courage, and let us be courageous for our people, and for the cities of our God, and may the LORD do what seems good to him.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10010013-1">13&nbsp;</b>So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him. <b class="verse-num" id="v10010014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p10010014_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10010015-1">15&nbsp;</b>But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together. <b class="verse-num" id="v10010016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; River&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> They came to Helam, with Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head. <b class="verse-num" id="v10010017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to Helam. The Syrians arrayed themselves against David and fought with him. <b class="verse-num" id="v10010018-1">18&nbsp;</b>And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the men of 700 chariots, and 40,000 horsemen, and wounded Shobach the commander of their army, so that he died there. <b class="verse-num" id="v10010019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became subject to them. So the Syrians were afraid to save the Ammonites anymore.</p>
<h3 id="p10011001_06-1">David and Bathsheba</h3>
<p id="p10011001_09-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v10011001-1">11&nbsp;</b>In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel. And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p10011001_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10011002-1">2&nbsp;</b>It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking on the roof of the king’s house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011003-1">3&nbsp;</b>And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, “Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?” <b class="verse-num" id="v10011004-1">4&nbsp;</b>So David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned to her house. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011005-1">5&nbsp;</b>And the woman conceived, and she sent and told David, “I am pregnant.”</p>
<p id="p10011005_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10011006-1">6&nbsp;</b>So David sent word to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” And Joab sent Uriah to David. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011007-1">7&nbsp;</b>When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab was doing and how the people were doing and how the war was going. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” And Uriah went out of the king’s house, and there followed him a present from the king. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011009-1">9&nbsp;</b>But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011010-1">10&nbsp;</b>When they told David, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?” <b class="verse-num" id="v10011011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10011012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Then David said to Uriah, “Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011013-1">13&nbsp;</b>And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, so that he made him drunk. And in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.</p>
<p id="p10011013_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10011014-1">14&nbsp;</b>In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011015-1">15&nbsp;</b>In the letter he wrote, “Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10011016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And as Joab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew there were valiant men. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, and some of the servants of David among the people fell. Uriah the Hittite also died. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011018-1">18&nbsp;</b>Then Joab sent and told David all the news about the fighting. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And he instructed the messenger, “When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king, <b class="verse-num" id="v10011020-1">20&nbsp;</b>then, if the king’s anger rises, and if he says to you, ‘Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall? <b class="verse-num" id="v10011021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’”</p>
<p id="p10011021_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10011022-1">22&nbsp;</b>So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to tell. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011023-1">23&nbsp;</b>The messenger said to David, “The men gained an advantage over us and came out against us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011024-1">24&nbsp;</b>Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall. Some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10011025-1">25&nbsp;</b>David said to the messenger, “Thus shall you say to Joab, ‘Do not let this matter displease you, for the sword devours now one and now another. Strengthen your attack against the city and overthrow it.’ And encourage him.”</p>
<p id="p10011025_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10011026-1">26&nbsp;</b>When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she lamented over her husband. <b class="verse-num" id="v10011027-1">27&nbsp;</b>And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</p>
<h3 id="p10012001_09-1">Nathan Rebukes David</h3>
<p id="p10012001_12-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v10012001-1">12&nbsp;</b>And the LORD sent Nathan to David. He came to him and said to him, “There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012002-1">2&nbsp;</b>The rich man had very many flocks and herds, <b class="verse-num" id="v10012003-1">3&nbsp;</b>but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children. It used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;bosom&lt;/i&gt;; also verse 8&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup> and it was like a daughter to him. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012004-1">4&nbsp;</b>Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him, but he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10012005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Then David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As the LORD lives, the man who has done this deserves to die, <b class="verse-num" id="v10012006-1">6&nbsp;</b>and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.”</p>
<p id="p10012006_12-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10012007-1">7&nbsp;</b>Nathan said to David, “You are the man! Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And I gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your arms and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah. And if this were too little, I would add to you as much more. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Why have you despised the word of the LORD, to do what is evil in his sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012010-1">10&nbsp;</b>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v10012011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house. And I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012012-1">12&nbsp;</b>For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v10012013-1">13&nbsp;</b>David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.” And Nathan said to David, “The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012014-1">14&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the LORD,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot;&gt;Masoretic Text &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; enemies of the &lt;span class=&quot;divine-name&quot;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;; Dead Sea Scroll &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; word of the &lt;span class=&quot;divine-name&quot;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> the child who is born to you shall die.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10012015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Then Nathan went to his house.</p>
<h3 id="p10012015_12-1">David’s Child Dies</h3>
<p id="p10012015_15-1">And the LORD afflicted the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and he became sick. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012016-1">16&nbsp;</b>David therefore sought God on behalf of the child. And David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And the elders of his house stood beside him, to raise him from the ground, but he would not, nor did he eat food with them. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012018-1">18&nbsp;</b>On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us. How then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10012019-1">19&nbsp;</b>But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David understood that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” They said, “He is dead.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10012020-1">20&nbsp;</b>Then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. He then went to his own house. And when he asked, they set food before him, and he ate. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10012022-1">22&nbsp;</b>He said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, ‘Who knows whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?’ <b class="verse-num" id="v10012023-1">23&nbsp;</b>But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.”</p>
<h3 id="p10012023_15-1">Solomon’s Birth</h3>
<p id="p10012023_17-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10012024-1">24&nbsp;</b>Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her, and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And the LORD loved him <b class="verse-num" id="v10012025-1">25&nbsp;</b>and sent a message by Nathan the prophet. So he called his name Jedidiah,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Jedidiah&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;beloved of the &lt;span class=&quot;divine-name&quot;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">5</a></sup> because of the LORD.</p>
<h3 id="p10012025_17-1">Rabbah Is Captured</h3>
<p id="p10012025_20-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10012026-1">26&nbsp;</b>Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and took the royal city. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012027-1">27&nbsp;</b>And Joab sent messengers to David and said, “I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the city of waters. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012028-1">28&nbsp;</b>Now then gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called by my name.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10012029-1">29&nbsp;</b>So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took it. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012030-1">30&nbsp;</b>And he took the crown of their king from his head. The weight of it was a talent<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f6-1" id="fb6-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;background&quot; sub-class=&quot;measurement&quot;&gt;A &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;talent&lt;/i&gt; was about 75 pounds or 34 kilograms&lt;/note&gt;">6</a></sup> of gold, and in it was a precious stone, and it was placed on David’s head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount. <b class="verse-num" id="v10012031-1">31&nbsp;</b>And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes and made them toil at<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f7-1" id="fb7-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;pass through&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">7</a></sup> the brick kilns.
