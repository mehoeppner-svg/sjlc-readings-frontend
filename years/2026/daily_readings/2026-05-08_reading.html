<p id="p10001001_06-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v10001001-1">1&nbsp;</b>After the death of Saul, when David had returned from striking down the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag. <b class="verse-num" id="v10001002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul’s camp, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and paid homage. <b class="verse-num" id="v10001003-1">3&nbsp;</b>David said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10001004-1">4&nbsp;</b>And David said to him, “How did it go? Tell me.” And he answered, “The people fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10001005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Then David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” <b class="verse-num" id="v10001006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And the young man who told him said, “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and behold, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him. <b class="verse-num" id="v10001007-1">7&nbsp;</b>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v10001008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v10001009-1">9&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, ‘Stand beside me and kill me, for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v10001010-1">10&nbsp;</b>So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”</p>
<p id="p10001010_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10001011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him. <b class="verse-num" id="v10001012-1">12&nbsp;</b>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. <b class="verse-num" id="v10001013-1">13&nbsp;</b>And David said to the young man who told him, “Where do you come from?” And he answered, “I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10001014-1">14&nbsp;</b>David said to him, “How is it you were not afraid to put out your hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?” <b class="verse-num" id="v10001015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Then David called one of the young men and said, “Go, execute him.” And he struck him down so that he died. <b class="verse-num" id="v10001016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And David said to him, “Your blood be on your head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the LORD’s anointed.’”</p>

<h3 id="p10002011_22-1">The Battle of Gibeon</h3>
<p id="p10002011_26-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10002012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. <b class="verse-num" id="v10002013-1">13&nbsp;</b>And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. <b class="verse-num" id="v10002014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men arise and compete before us.” And Joab said, “Let them arise.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10002015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Then they arose and passed over by number, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. <b class="verse-num" id="v10002016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side, so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Helkath-hazzurim&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;the field of sword-edges&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> which is at Gibeon. <b class="verse-num" id="v10002017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And the battle was very fierce that day.

<p id="p10002017_26-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10002018-1">18&nbsp;</b>And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as swift of foot as a wild gazelle. <b class="verse-num" id="v10002019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And Asahel pursued Abner, and as he went, he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. <b class="verse-num" id="v10002020-1">20&nbsp;</b>Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Is it you, Asahel?” And he answered, “It is I.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10002021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and seize one of the young men and take his spoil.” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. <b class="verse-num" id="v10002022-1">22&nbsp;</b>And Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?” <b class="verse-num" id="v10002023-1">23&nbsp;</b>But he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died where he was. And all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.</p>
<p id="p10002023_26-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10002024-1">24&nbsp;</b>But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. And as the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah, which lies before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. <b class="verse-num" id="v10002025-1">25&nbsp;</b>And the people of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one group and took their stand on the top of a hill. <b class="verse-num" id="v10002026-1">26&nbsp;</b>Then Abner called to Joab, “Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you tell your people to turn from the pursuit of their brothers?” <b class="verse-num" id="v10002027-1">27&nbsp;</b>And Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely the men would not have given up the pursuit of their brothers until the morning.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10002028-1">28&nbsp;</b>So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men stopped and pursued Israel no more, nor did they fight anymore.</p>
<p id="p10002028_26-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10002029-1">29&nbsp;</b>And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, and marching the whole morning, they came to Mahanaim. <b class="verse-num" id="v10002030-1">30&nbsp;</b>Joab returned from the pursuit of Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing from David’s servants nineteen men besides Asahel. <b class="verse-num" id="v10002031-1">31&nbsp;</b>But the servants of David had struck down of Benjamin 360 of Abner’s men. <b class="verse-num" id="v10002032-1">32&nbsp;</b>And they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem. And Joab and his men marched all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.</p>
