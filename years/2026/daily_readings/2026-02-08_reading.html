<p id="p02004009_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02004010-1">10&nbsp;</b>But Moses said to the LORD, “Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, but I am slow of speech and of tongue.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02004011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to him, “Who has made man’s mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the LORD? <b class="verse-num" id="v02004012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02004013-1">13&nbsp;</b>But he said, “Oh, my Lord, please send someone else.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02004014-1">14&nbsp;</b>Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses and he said, “Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. <b class="verse-num" id="v02004015-1">15&nbsp;</b>You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both what to do. <b class="verse-num" id="v02004016-1">16&nbsp;</b>He shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth, and you shall be as God to him. <b class="verse-num" id="v02004017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And take in your hand this staff, with which you shall do the signs.”</p>
<h3 id="p02004017_05-1">Moses Returns to Egypt</h3>
<p id="p02004017_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02004018-1">18&nbsp;</b>Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Please let me go back to my brothers in Egypt to see whether they are still alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02004019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life are dead.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02004020-1">20&nbsp;</b>So Moses took his wife and his sons and had them ride on a donkey, and went back to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.</p>
<p id="p02004020_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02004021-1">21&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the miracles that I have put in your power. But I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go. <b class="verse-num" id="v02004022-1">22&nbsp;</b>Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the LORD, Israel is my firstborn son, <b class="verse-num" id="v02004023-1">23&nbsp;</b>and I say to you, “Let my son go that he may serve me.” If you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your firstborn son.’”</p>
<p id="p02004023_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02004024-1">24&nbsp;</b>At a lodging place on the way the LORD met him and sought to put him to death. <b class="verse-num" id="v02004025-1">25&nbsp;</b>Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin and touched Moses’<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup> feet with it and said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me!” <b class="verse-num" id="v02004026-1">26&nbsp;</b>So he let him alone. It was then that she said, “A bridegroom of blood,” because of the circumcision.</p>
<p id="p02004026_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02004027-1">27&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him. <b class="verse-num" id="v02004028-1">28&nbsp;</b>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which he had sent him to speak, and all the signs that he had commanded him to do. <b class="verse-num" id="v02004029-1">29&nbsp;</b>Then Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the people of Israel. <b class="verse-num" id="v02004030-1">30&nbsp;</b>Aaron spoke all the words that the LORD had spoken to Moses and did the signs in the sight of the people. <b class="verse-num" id="v02004031-1">31&nbsp;</b>And the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD had visited the people of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, they bowed their heads and worshiped.</p>
<h3 id="p02005001_09-1">Making Bricks Without Straw</h3>
<p id="p02005001_13-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v02005001-1">5&nbsp;</b>Afterward Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v02005002-1">2&nbsp;</b>But Pharaoh said, “Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and moreover, I will not let Israel go.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02005003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02005004-1">4&nbsp;</b>But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02005005-1">5&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot;&gt;Samaritan &lt;i&gt;they are now more numerous than the people of the land&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> and you make them rest from their burdens!” <b class="verse-num" id="v02005006-1">6&nbsp;</b>The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen, <b class="verse-num" id="v02005007-1">7&nbsp;</b>“You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as in the past; let them go and gather straw for themselves. <b class="verse-num" id="v02005008-1">8&nbsp;</b>But the number of bricks that they made in the past you shall impose on them, you shall by no means reduce it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, ‘Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v02005009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Let heavier work be laid on the men that they may labor at it and pay no regard to lying words.”</p>
<p id="p02005009_13-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02005010-1">10&nbsp;</b>So the taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said to the people, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I will not give you straw. <b class="verse-num" id="v02005011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Go and get your straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced in the least.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v02005012-1">12&nbsp;</b>So the people were scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. <b class="verse-num" id="v02005013-1">13&nbsp;</b>The taskmasters were urgent, saying, “Complete your work, your daily task each day, as when there was straw.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02005014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, “Why have you not done all your task of making bricks today and yesterday, as in the past?”</p>
<p id="p02005014_13-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02005015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, “Why do you treat your servants like this? <b class="verse-num" id="v02005016-1">16&nbsp;</b>No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02005017-1">17&nbsp;</b>But he said, “You are idle, you are idle; that is why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v02005018-1">18&nbsp;</b>Go now and work. No straw will be given you, but you must still deliver the same number of bricks.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02005019-1">19&nbsp;</b>The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in trouble when they said, “You shall by no means reduce your number of bricks, your daily task each day.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02005020-1">20&nbsp;</b>They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came out from Pharaoh; <b class="verse-num" id="v02005021-1">21&nbsp;</b>and they said to them, “The LORD look on you and judge, because you have made us stink in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”</p>
<p id="p02005021_13-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02005022-1">22&nbsp;</b>Then Moses turned to the LORD and said, “O Lord, why have you done evil to this people? Why did you ever send me? <b class="verse-num" id="v02005023-1">23&nbsp;</b>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you have not delivered your people at all.”</p>

<p id="p02006001_16-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v02006001-1">6&nbsp;</b>But the LORD said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand he will send them out, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”</p>
<p id="p02006001_16-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02006002-1">2&nbsp;</b>God spoke to Moses and said to him, “I am the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v02006003-1">3&nbsp;</b>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i language=&quot;Hebrew&quot;&gt;El Shaddai&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">5</a></sup> but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them. <b class="verse-num" id="v02006004-1">4&nbsp;</b>I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as sojourners. <b class="verse-num" id="v02006005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves, and I have remembered my covenant. <b class="verse-num" id="v02006006-1">6&nbsp;</b>Say therefore to the people of Israel, ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from slavery to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment. <b class="verse-num" id="v02006007-1">7&nbsp;</b>I will take you to be my people, and I will be your God, and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. <b class="verse-num" id="v02006008-1">8&nbsp;</b>I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. I will give it to you for a possession. I am the LORD.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v02006009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses, because of their broken spirit and harsh slavery.</p>
<p id="p02006009_16-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02006010-1">10&nbsp;</b>So the LORD said to Moses, <b class="verse-num" id="v02006011-1">11&nbsp;</b>“Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the people of Israel go out of his land.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02006012-1">12&nbsp;</b>But Moses said to the LORD, “Behold, the people of Israel have not listened to me.
