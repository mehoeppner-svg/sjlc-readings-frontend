<p id="p42004031_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v42004031-1">31&nbsp;</b>And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath, <b class="verse-num" id="v42004032-1">32&nbsp;</b>and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word possessed authority. <b class="verse-num" id="v42004033-1">33&nbsp;</b>And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, <b class="verse-num" id="v42004034-1">34&nbsp;</b>“Ha!<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;Leave us alone&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God.” <b class="verse-num" id="v42004035-1">35&nbsp;</b>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class="woc">“Be silent and come out of him!”</span> And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm. <b class="verse-num" id="v42004036-1">36&nbsp;</b>And they were all amazed and said to one another, “What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!” <b class="verse-num" id="v42004037-1">37&nbsp;</b>And reports about him went out into every place in the surrounding region.</p>
<h3 id="p42004037_09-1">Jesus Heals Many</h3>
<p id="p42004037_12-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v42004038-1">38&nbsp;</b>And he arose and left the synagogue and entered Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they appealed to him on her behalf. <b class="verse-num" id="v42004039-1">39&nbsp;</b>And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately she rose and began to serve them.</p>
<p id="p42004039_12-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v42004040-1">40&nbsp;</b>Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to him, and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them. <b class="verse-num" id="v42004041-1">41&nbsp;</b>And demons also came out of many, crying, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</p>
