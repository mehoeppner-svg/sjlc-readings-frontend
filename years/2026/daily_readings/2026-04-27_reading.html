Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent home, every man to his tent. <b class="verse-num" id="v09013003-1">3 </b>Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines that was at Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09013004-1">4 </b>And all Israel heard it said that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become a stench to the Philistines. And the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.</p>
<p id="p09013004_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09013005-1">5 </b>And the Philistines mustered to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth-aven. <b class="verse-num" id="v09013006-1">6 </b>When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns, <b class="verse-num" id="v09013007-1">7 </b>and some Hebrews crossed the fords of the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</p>
<h3 id="p09013007_05-1">Saul’s Unlawful Sacrifice</h3>
<p id="p09013007_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09013008-1">8 </b>He waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him. <b class="verse-num" id="v09013009-1">9 </b>So Saul said, “Bring the burnt offering here to me, and the peace offerings.” And he offered the burnt offering. <b class="verse-num" id="v09013010-1">10 </b>As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came. And Saul went out to meet him and greet him. <b class="verse-num" id="v09013011-1">11 </b>Samuel said, “What have you done?” And Saul said, “When I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines had mustered at Michmash, <b class="verse-num" id="v09013012-1">12 </b>I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the LORD.’ So I forced myself, and offered the burnt offering.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09013013-1">13 </b>And Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly. You have not kept the command of the LORD your God, with which he commanded you. For then the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. <b class="verse-num" id="v09013014-1">14 </b>But now your kingdom shall not continue. The LORD has sought out a man after his own heart, and the LORD has commanded him to be prince<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title='&lt;note class="alternative"&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;leader&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>2</a></sup> over his people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09013015-1">15 </b>And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal. The rest of the people went up after Saul to meet the army; they went up from Gilgal<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title='&lt;note class="variant" sub-class="variant-lacks"&gt;Septuagint; Hebrew lacks &lt;i class="catch-word"&gt;The rest of the people . . . from Gilgal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>3</a></sup> to Gibeah of Benjamin.</p>
<p id="p09013015_08-1">And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men. <b class="verse-num" id="v09013016-1">16 </b>And Saul and Jonathan his son and the people who were present with them stayed in Geba of Benjamin, but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. <b class="verse-num" id="v09013017-1">17 </b>And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual; <b class="verse-num" id="v09013018-1">18 </b>another company turned toward Beth-horon; and another company turned toward the border that looks down on the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</p>
<p id="p09013018_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09013019-1">19 </b>Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09013020-1">20 </b>But every one of the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, or his sickle,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title='&lt;note class="variant"&gt;Septuagint; Hebrew &lt;i&gt;plowshare&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>4</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v09013021-1">21 </b>and the charge was two-thirds of a shekel<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title='&lt;note class="background" sub-class="measurement"&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="catch-word"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; a pim&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>5</a></sup> for the plowshares and for the mattocks, and a third of a shekel<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f6-1" id="fb6-1" title='&lt;note class="background" sub-class="measurement"&gt;A &lt;i class="catch-word"&gt;shekel&lt;/i&gt; was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams&lt;/note&gt;'>6</a></sup> for sharpening the axes and for setting the goads.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f7-1" id="fb7-1" title='&lt;note class="translation" sub-class="meaning-uncertain"&gt;The meaning of the Hebrew verse is uncertain&lt;/note&gt;'>7</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v09013022-1">22 </b>So on the day of the battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan, but Saul and Jonathan his son had them. <b class="verse-num" id="v09013023-1">23 </b>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.</p>
<h3 id="p09014001_08-1">Jonathan Defeats the Philistines</h3>
<p class="starts-chapter" id="p09014001_12-1"><b class="chapter-num" id="v09014001-1">14 </b>One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who carried his armor, “Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on the other side.” But he did not tell his father. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014002-1">2 </b>Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah in the pomegranate cave<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f8-1" id="fb8-1" title='&lt;note class="alternative"&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;under the pomegranate&lt;/i&gt; [tree]&lt;/note&gt;'>8</a></sup> at Migron. The people who were with him were about six hundred men, <b class="verse-num" id="v09014003-1">3 </b>including Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014004-1">4 </b>Within the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side. The name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014005-1">5 </b>The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.</p>
<p id="p09014005_12-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09014006-1">6 </b>Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the LORD will work for us, for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many or by few.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09014007-1">7 </b>And his armor-bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Do as you wish.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f9-1" id="fb9-1" title='&lt;note class="variant"&gt;Septuagint &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="catch-word"&gt;Do&lt;/span&gt; all that your mind inclines to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>9</a></sup> Behold, I am with you heart and soul.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09014008-1">8 </b>Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014009-1">9 </b>If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014010-1">10 </b>But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for the LORD has given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09014011-1">11 </b>So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, “Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09014012-1">12 </b>And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.” And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Come up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09014013-1">13 </b>Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014014-1">14 </b>And that first strike, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, killed about twenty men within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f10-1" id="fb10-1" title='&lt;note class="background" sub-class="measurement"&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="catch-word"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; yoke&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>10</a></sup> of land. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014015-1">15 </b>And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and even the raiders trembled, the earth quaked, and it became a very great panic.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f11-1" id="fb11-1" title='&lt;note class="alternative"&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="catch-word"&gt;became a&lt;/span&gt; panic from God&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>11</a></sup></p>
<p id="p09014015_12-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09014016-1">16 </b>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude was dispersing here and there.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f12-1" id="fb12-1" title='&lt;note class="variant"&gt;Septuagint; Hebrew &lt;i&gt;they went here and there&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>12</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v09014017-1">17 </b>Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Count and see who has gone from us.” And when they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014018-1">18 </b>So Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God went at that time with the people<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f13-1" id="fb13-1" title='&lt;note class="variant"&gt;Hebrew; Septuagint &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="catch-word"&gt;“Bring the&lt;/span&gt; ephod.” For at that time he wore the ephod before the people&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>13</a></sup> of Israel. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014019-1">19 </b>Now while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09014020-1">20 </b>Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle. And behold, every Philistine’s sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014021-1">21 </b>Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014022-1">22 </b>Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014023-1">23 </b>So the LORD saved Israel that day. And the battle passed beyond Beth-aven.</p>
<h3 id="p09014023_12-1">Saul’s Rash Vow</h3>
<p id="p09014023_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09014024-1">24 </b>And the men of Israel had been hard pressed that day, so Saul had laid an oath on the people, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies.” So none of the people had tasted food. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014025-1">25 </b>Now when all the people<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f14-1" id="fb14-1" title='&lt;note class="translation" sub-class="original"&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;land&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>14</a></sup> came to the forest, behold, there was honey on the ground. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014026-1">26 </b>And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014027-1">27 </b>But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath, so he put out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes became bright. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014028-1">28 </b>Then one of the people said, “Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food this day.’” And the people were faint. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014029-1">29 </b>Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. See how my eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014030-1">30 </b>How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found. For now the defeat among the Philistines has not been great.”</p>
<p id="p09014030_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09014031-1">31 </b>They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014032-1">32 </b>The people pounced on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground. And the people ate them with the blood. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014033-1">33 </b>Then they told Saul, “Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood.” And he said, “You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here.”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f15-1" id="fb15-1" title='&lt;note class="variant"&gt;Septuagint; Hebrew &lt;i&gt;this day&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>15</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v09014034-1">34 </b>And Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, ‘Let every man bring his ox or his sheep and slaughter them here and eat, and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.’” So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night and they slaughtered them there. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014035-1">35 </b>And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.</p>
<p id="p09014035_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09014036-1">36 </b>Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09014037-1">37 </b>And Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him that day. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014038-1">38 </b>And Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the people, and know and see how this sin has arisen today. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014039-1">39 </b>For as the LORD lives who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014040-1">40 </b>Then he said to all Israel, “You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09014041-1">41 </b>Therefore Saul said, “O LORD God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, O LORD, God of Israel, give Urim. But if this guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim.”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f16-1" id="fb16-1" title='&lt;note class="variant"&gt;Vulgate and Septuagint; Hebrew &lt;i&gt;Therefore &lt;span class="catch-word"&gt;Saul said&lt;/span&gt; to the &lt;span class="divine-name"&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt;, the God of Israel, “Give Thummim.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>16</a></sup> And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014042-1">42 </b>Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was taken.</p>
<p id="p09014042_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09014043-1">43 </b>Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am; I will die.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09014044-1">44 </b>And Saul said, “God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09014045-1">45 </b>Then the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the people ransomed Jonathan, so that he did not die. <b class="verse-num" id="v09014046-1">46 </b>Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.</p>

<p id="p09014048_19-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09014049-1">49 </b>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua.

<h3 id="p42019028_01-1">The Triumphal Entry</h3>
<p id="p42019028_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v42019028-1">28 </b>And when he had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. <b class="verse-num" id="v42019029-1">29 </b>When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples, <b class="verse-num" id="v42019030-1">30 </b>saying, <span class="woc">“Go into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42019031-1">31 </b><span class="woc">If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say this: ‘The Lord has need of it.’”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v42019032-1">32 </b>So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them. <b class="verse-num" id="v42019033-1">33 </b>And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?” <b class="verse-num" id="v42019034-1">34 </b>And they said, “The Lord has need of it.” <b class="verse-num" id="v42019035-1">35 </b>And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it. <b class="verse-num" id="v42019036-1">36 </b>And as he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road. <b class="verse-num" id="v42019037-1">37 </b>As he was drawing near—already on the way down the Mount of Olives—the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, <b class="verse-num" id="v42019038-1">38 </b>saying, “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!” <b class="verse-num" id="v42019039-1">39 </b>And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.” <b class="verse-num" id="v42019040-1">40 </b>He answered, <span class="woc">“I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out.”</span></p>
<h3 id="p42019040_04-1">Jesus Weeps over Jerusalem</h3>
<p id="p42019040_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v42019041-1">41 </b>And when he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it, <b class="verse-num" id="v42019042-1">42 </b>saying, <span class="woc">“Would that you, even you, had known on this day the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42019043-1">43 </b><span class="woc">For the days will come upon you, when your enemies will set up a barricade around you and surround you and hem you in on every side</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42019044-1">44 </b><span class="woc">and tear you down to the ground, you and your children within you. And they will not leave one stone upon another in you, because you did not know the time of your visitation.”</span></p>
<h3 id="p42019044_08-1">Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h3>
<p id="p42019044_12-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v42019045-1">45 </b>And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold, <b class="verse-num" id="v42019046-1">46 </b>saying to them, <span class="woc">“It is written, ‘My house shall be a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a den of robbers.”</span></p>
<p id="p42019046_12-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v42019047-1">47 </b>And he was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people were seeking to destroy him, <b class="verse-num" id="v42019048-1">48 </b>but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people were hanging on his words.</p>
