<p id="p02010001_05-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v02010001-1">10&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may show these signs of mine among them, <b class="verse-num" id="v02010002-1">2&nbsp;</b>and <sup><a class="cf" href="Exodus 13:8; Exodus 13:14; Deuteronomy 4:9; Deuteronomy 6:20–22; Psalm 78:5–7; Joel 1:3/" title="[ch. 13:8, 14; Deut. 4:9; 6:20-22; Ps. 78:5-7; Joel 1:3]">s</a></sup>that you may tell in the hearing of your son and of your grandson how I have dealt harshly with the Egyptians and what signs I have done among them, <sup><a class="cf" href="Exodus 7:17/" title="ch. 7:17">t</a></sup>that you may know that I am the LORD.”</p>
<p id="p02010002_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02010003-1">3&nbsp;</b>So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, ‘How long will you refuse to <sup><a class="cf" href="1 Kings 21:29/" title="1 Kgs. 21:29">u</a></sup>humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me. <b class="verse-num" id="v02010004-1">4&nbsp;</b>For if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring <sup><a class="cf" href="Leviticus 11:22; Proverbs 30:27; Joel 1:4; Joel 2:25; Revelation 9:3/" title="Lev. 11:22; Prov. 30:27; Joel 1:4; 2:25; Rev. 9:3">v</a></sup>locusts into your country, <b class="verse-num" id="v02010005-1">5&nbsp;</b>and they shall cover the face of the land, so that no one can see the land. And they shall <sup><a class="cf" href="Exodus 9:32/" title="ch. 9:32">w</a></sup>eat what is left to you after the hail, and they shall eat every tree of yours that grows in the field, <b class="verse-num" id="v02010006-1">6&nbsp;</b>and they shall fill <sup><a class="cf" href="Exodus 8:3; Exodus 8:21; Joel 2:9/" title="[ch. 8:3, 21; Joel 2:9]">x</a></sup>your houses and the houses of all your servants and of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from the day they came on earth to this day.’” Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh.</p>
<p id="p02010006_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02010007-1">7&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not yet understand that Egypt is ruined?” <b class="verse-num" id="v02010008-1">8&nbsp;</b>So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. And he said to them, <sup><a class="cf" href="Exodus 10:24/" title="ver. 24">y</a></sup>“Go, serve the LORD your God. But which ones are to go?” <b class="verse-num" id="v02010009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Moses said, “We will go with our young and our old. We will go with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds, for <sup><a class="cf" href="Exodus 5:1; Exodus 3:18/" title="ch. 5:1; [ch. 3:18]">z</a></sup>we must hold a feast to the LORD.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02010010-1">10&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, “The LORD be with you, if ever I let you and your <sup><a class="cf" href="Exodus 10:24/" title="ver. 24">a</a></sup>little ones go! Look, you have some evil purpose in mind.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;before your face&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v02010011-1">11&nbsp;</b>No!

Not a green thing remained, neither tree nor plant of the field, through all the land of Egypt. <b class="verse-num" id="v02010016-1">16&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh hastily called Moses and Aaron and said, <sup><a class="cf" href="Exodus 9:27/" title="ch. 9:27">g</a></sup>“I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. <b class="verse-num" id="v02010017-1">17&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, forgive my sin, please, only this once, and <sup><a class="cf" href="Exodus 8:8/" title="See ch. 8:8">h</a></sup>plead with the LORD your God only to remove this death from me.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02010018-1">18&nbsp;</b>So <sup><a class="cf" href="Exodus 8:30; Exodus 9:33/" title="ch. 8:30; 9:33">i</a></sup>he went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v02010019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And the LORD turned the wind into a very strong west wind, which lifted the locusts and drove them <sup><a class="cf" href="Joel 2:20/" title="[Joel 2:20]">j</a></sup>into the Red Sea. Not a single locust was left in all the country of Egypt. <b class="verse-num" id="v02010020-1">20&nbsp;</b>But the LORD <sup><a class="cf" href="Exodus 4:21/" title="See ch. 4:21">k</a></sup>hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go.</p>
