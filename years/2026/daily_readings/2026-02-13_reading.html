<p id="p02016001_04-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v02016001-1">16&nbsp;</b>They set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the people of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had departed from the land of Egypt. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And the whole congregation of the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness, <b class="verse-num" id="v02016003-1">3&nbsp;</b>and the people of Israel said to them, “Would that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots and ate bread to the full, for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”</p>
<p id="p02016003_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02016004-1">4&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016005-1">5&nbsp;</b>On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02016006-1">6&nbsp;</b>So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, “At evening you shall know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, <b class="verse-num" id="v02016007-1">7&nbsp;</b>and in the morning you shall see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against the LORD. For what are we, that you grumble against us?” <b class="verse-num" id="v02016008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And Moses said, “When the LORD gives you in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to the full, because the LORD has heard your grumbling that you grumble against him—what are we? Your grumbling is not against us but against the LORD.”</p>
<p id="p02016008_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02016009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, ‘Come near before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v02016010-1">10&nbsp;</b>And as soon as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016011-1">11&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, <b class="verse-num" id="v02016012-1">12&nbsp;</b>“I have heard the grumbling of the people of Israel. Say to them, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.’”</p>
<p id="p02016012_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02016013-1">13&nbsp;</b>In the evening quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning dew lay around the camp. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as frost on the ground. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016015-1">15&nbsp;</b>When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;“It is manna”&lt;/i&gt;; Hebrew &lt;i&gt;man hu&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, “It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016016-1">16&nbsp;</b>This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Gather of it, each one of you, as much as he can eat. You shall each take an omer,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;background&quot; sub-class=&quot;measurement&quot;&gt;An &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;omer&lt;/i&gt; was about 2 quarts or 2 liters&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> according to the number of the persons that each of you has in his tent.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v02016017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016018-1">18&nbsp;</b>But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to them, “Let no one leave any of it over till the morning.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02016020-1">20&nbsp;</b>But they did not listen to Moses. Some left part of it till the morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat; but when the sun grew hot, it melted.</p>
<p id="p02016021_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02016022-1">22&nbsp;</b>On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers each. And when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses, <b class="verse-num" id="v02016023-1">23&nbsp;</b>he said to them, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD; bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over lay aside to be kept till the morning.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v02016024-1">24&nbsp;</b>So they laid it aside till the morning, as Moses commanded them, and it did not stink, and there were no worms in it. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016025-1">25&nbsp;</b>Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016026-1">26&nbsp;</b>Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none.”</p>
<p id="p02016026_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02016027-1">27&nbsp;</b>On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016028-1">28&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws? <b class="verse-num" id="v02016029-1">29&nbsp;</b>See! The LORD has given you the Sabbath; therefore on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Remain each of you in his place; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02016030-1">30&nbsp;</b>So the people rested on the seventh day.</p>
<p id="p02016030_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02016031-1">31&nbsp;</b>Now the house of Israel called its name manna. It was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016032-1">32&nbsp;</b>Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, so that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v02016033-1">33&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02016034-1">34&nbsp;</b>As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016035-1">35&nbsp;</b>The people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land. They ate the manna till they came to the border of the land of Canaan. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016036-1">36&nbsp;</b>(An omer is the tenth part of an ephah.)<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;background&quot; sub-class=&quot;measurement&quot;&gt;An &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;ephah&lt;/i&gt; was about 3/5 bushel or 22 liters&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="p02017001_04-1">Water from the Rock</h3>
<p id="p02017001_08-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v02017001-1">17&nbsp;</b>All the congregation of the people of Israel moved on from the wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. <b class="verse-num" id="v02017002-1">2&nbsp;</b>Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the LORD?” <b class="verse-num" id="v02017003-1">3&nbsp;</b>But the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?” <b class="verse-num" id="v02017004-1">4&nbsp;</b>So Moses cried to the LORD, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02017005-1">5&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to Moses, “Pass on before the people, taking with you some of the elders of Israel, and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. <b class="verse-num" id="v02017006-1">6&nbsp;</b>Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people will drink.” And Moses did so, in the sight of the elders of Israel. <b class="verse-num" id="v02017007-1">7&nbsp;</b>And he called the name of the place Massah<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Massah&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;testing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> and Meribah,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Meribah&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;quarreling&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">5</a></sup> because of the quarreling of the people of Israel, and because they tested the LORD by saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”</p>
<h3 id="p02017007_08-1">Israel Defeats Amalek</h3>
<p id="p02017007_11-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02017008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Then Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim. <b class="verse-num" id="v02017009-1">9&nbsp;</b>So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose for us men, and go out and fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02017010-1">10&nbsp;</b>So Joshua did as Moses told him, and fought with Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. <b class="verse-num" id="v02017011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, and whenever he lowered his hand, Amalek prevailed. <b class="verse-num" id="v02017012-1">12&nbsp;</b>But Moses’ hands grew weary, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it, while Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side. So his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. <b class="verse-num" id="v02017013-1">13&nbsp;</b>And Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his people with the sword.</p>
<p id="p02017013_11-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02017014-1">14&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02017015-1">15&nbsp;</b>And Moses built an altar and called the name of it, The LORD Is My Banner, <b class="verse-num" id="v02017016-1">16&nbsp;</b>saying, “A hand upon the throne<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f6-1" id="fb6-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;slight-change&quot;&gt;A slight change would yield &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;upon the&lt;/span&gt; banner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">6</a></sup> of the LORD!

And they asked each other of their welfare and went into the tent. <b class="verse-num" id="v02018008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Then Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardship that had come upon them in the way, and how the LORD had delivered them. <b class="verse-num" id="v02018009-1">9&nbsp;</b>And Jethro rejoiced for all the good that the LORD had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.</p>
<p id="p02018009_13-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02018010-1">10&nbsp;</b>Jethro said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh and has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. <b class="verse-num" id="v02018011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods, because in this affair they dealt arrogantly with the people.”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f10-1" id="fb10-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;with them&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">10</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v02018012-1">12&nbsp;</b>And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.</p>

<h3 id="p40027001_01-1">Jesus Delivered to Pilate</h3>
<p id="p40027001_05-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v40027001-1">27&nbsp;</b>When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor.</p>
<h3 id="p40027002_05-1">Judas Hangs Himself</h3>
<p id="p40027002_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40027003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Greek &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, <b class="verse-num" id="v40027004-1">4&nbsp;</b>saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” They said, “What is that to us? See to it yourself.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40027005-1">5&nbsp;</b>And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027006-1">6&nbsp;</b>But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40027007-1">7&nbsp;</b>So they took counsel and bought with them the potter’s field as a burial place for strangers. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, <b class="verse-num" id="v40027010-1">10&nbsp;</b>and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.”</p>

<p id="p40027010_11-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40027011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said, <span class="woc">“You have said so.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40027012-1">12&nbsp;</b>But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027013-1">13&nbsp;</b>Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?” <b class="verse-num" id="v40027014-1">14&nbsp;</b>But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.</p>
<h3 id="p40027014_11-1">The Crowd Chooses Barabbas</h3>
<p id="p40027014_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40027015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027017-1">17&nbsp;</b>So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” <b class="verse-num" id="v40027018-1">18&nbsp;</b>For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027019-1">19&nbsp;</b>Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40027020-1">20&nbsp;</b>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027021-1">21&nbsp;</b>The governor again said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40027022-1">22&nbsp;</b>Pilate said to them, “Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!” <b class="verse-num" id="v40027023-1">23&nbsp;</b>And he said, “Why? What evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Let him be crucified!”</p>
