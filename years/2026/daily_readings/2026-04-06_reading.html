<p id="p06001009_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06001010-1">10&nbsp;</b>And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, <b class="verse-num" id="v06001011-1">11&nbsp;</b>“Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, ‘Prepare your provisions, for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan to go in to take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.’”</p>

Then you shall return to the land of your possession and shall possess it, the land that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.”</p>
<p id="p06001015_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06001016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And they answered Joshua, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. <b class="verse-num" id="v06001017-1">17&nbsp;</b>Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you, as he was with Moses! <b class="verse-num" id="v06001018-1">18&nbsp;</b>Whoever rebels against your commandment and disobeys your words, whatever you command him, shall be put to death.

And she said, “True, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from. <b class="verse-num" id="v06002005-1">5&nbsp;</b>And when the gate was about to be closed at dark, the men went out. I do not know where the men went. Pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them.” <b class="verse-num" id="v06002006-1">6&nbsp;</b>But she had brought them up to the roof and hid them with the stalks of flax that she had laid in order on the roof. <b class="verse-num" id="v06002007-1">7&nbsp;</b>So the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords.

<p id="p06002014_11-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06002015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall, so that she lived in the wall. <b class="verse-num" id="v06002016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And she said<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;had said&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">5</a></sup> to them, “Go into the hills, or the pursuers will encounter you, and hide there three days until the pursuers have returned.

<p id="p06002021_11-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06002022-1">22&nbsp;</b>They departed and went into the hills and remained there three days until the pursuers returned, and the pursuers searched all along the way and found nothing. <b class="verse-num" id="v06002023-1">23&nbsp;</b>Then the two men returned. They came down from the hills and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and they told him all that had happened to them. <b class="verse-num" id="v06002024-1">24&nbsp;</b>And they said to Joshua, “Truly the LORD has given all the land into our hands.

Do not come near it, in order that you may know the way you shall go, for you have not passed this way before.” <b class="verse-num" id="v06003005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Then Joshua said to the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v06003006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on before the people.” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.</p>
<p id="p06003006_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06003007-1">7&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. <b class="verse-num" id="v06003008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And as for you, command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, ‘When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v06003009-1">9&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said to the people of Israel, “Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.” <b class="verse-num" id="v06003010-1">10&nbsp;</b>And Joshua said, “Here is how you shall know that the living God is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites. <b class="verse-num" id="v06003011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f7-1" id="fb7-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;the ark of the covenant&lt;/span&gt;, the Lord of all the earth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">7</a></sup> is passing over before you into the Jordan. <b class="verse-num" id="v06003012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Now therefore take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, from each tribe a man. <b class="verse-num" id="v06003013-1">13&nbsp;</b>And when the soles of the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off from flowing, and the waters coming down from above shall stand in one heap.”</p>
<p id="p06003013_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06003014-1">14&nbsp;</b>So when the people set out from their tents to pass over the Jordan with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people, <b class="verse-num" id="v06003015-1">15&nbsp;</b>and as soon as those bearing the ark had come as far as the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (now the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest), <b class="verse-num" id="v06003016-1">16&nbsp;</b>the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far away, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those flowing down toward the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. And the people passed over opposite Jericho. <b class="verse-num" id="v06003017-1">17&nbsp;</b>Now the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firmly on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all Israel was passing over on dry ground until all the nation finished passing over the Jordan.</p>
