<p id="p01023001_05-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01023001-1">23&nbsp;</b>Sarah lived 127 years; these were the years of the life of Sarah. <b class="verse-num" id="v01023002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And Sarah died at Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. <b class="verse-num" id="v01023003-1">3&nbsp;</b>And Abraham rose up from before his dead and said to the Hittites,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;sons of Heth&lt;/i&gt;; also verses 5, 7, 10, 16, 18, 20&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v01023004-1">4&nbsp;</b>“I am a sojourner and foreigner among you; give me property among you for a burying place, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01023005-1">5&nbsp;</b>The Hittites answered Abraham, <b class="verse-num" id="v01023006-1">6&nbsp;</b>“Hear us, my lord; you are a prince of God<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; mighty prince&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will withhold from you his tomb to hinder you from burying your dead.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01023007-1">7&nbsp;</b>Abraham rose and bowed to the Hittites, the people of the land. <b class="verse-num" id="v01023008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, “If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar, <b class="verse-num" id="v01023009-1">9&nbsp;</b>that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as property for a burying place.”</p>
<p id="p01023009_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01023010-1">10&nbsp;</b>Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites, and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city, <b class="verse-num" id="v01023011-1">11&nbsp;</b>“No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the sight of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01023012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land. <b class="verse-num" id="v01023013-1">13&nbsp;</b>And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, “But if you will, hear me: I give the price of the field. Accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01023014-1">14&nbsp;</b>Ephron answered Abraham, <b class="verse-num" id="v01023015-1">15&nbsp;</b>“My lord, listen to me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;background&quot; sub-class=&quot;measurement&quot;&gt;A &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word-plural&quot;&gt;shekel&lt;/i&gt; was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup> of silver, what is that between you and me? Bury your dead.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01023016-1">16&nbsp;</b>Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.</p>
<p id="p01023016_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01023017-1">17&nbsp;</b>So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave that was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, was made over <b class="verse-num" id="v01023018-1">18&nbsp;</b>to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who went in at the gate of his city. <b class="verse-num" id="v01023019-1">19&nbsp;</b>After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah east of Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. <b class="verse-num" id="v01023020-1">20&nbsp;</b>The field and the cave that is in it were made over to Abraham as property for a burying place by the Hittites.</p>
<h3 id="p01024001_05-1">Isaac and Rebekah</h3>
<p id="p01024001_08-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01024001-1">24&nbsp;</b>Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years. And the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he had, “Put your hand under my thigh, <b class="verse-num" id="v01024003-1">3&nbsp;</b>that I may make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell, <b class="verse-num" id="v01024004-1">4&nbsp;</b>but will go to my country and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024005-1">5&nbsp;</b>The servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman may not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from which you came?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024006-1">6&nbsp;</b>Abraham said to him, “See to it that you do not take my son back there. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024007-1">7&nbsp;</b>The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, ‘To your offspring I will give this land,’ he will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024008-1">8&nbsp;</b>But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only you must not take my son back there.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024009-1">9&nbsp;</b>So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.</p>
<p id="p01024009_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01024010-1">10&nbsp;</b>Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master; and he arose and went to Mesopotamia<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;Aram-naharaim&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> to the city of Nahor. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024011-1">11&nbsp;</b>And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time when women go out to draw water. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024012-1">12&nbsp;</b>And he said, “O LORD, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today and show steadfast love to my master Abraham. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024013-1">13&nbsp;</b>Behold, I am standing by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024014-1">14&nbsp;</b>Let the young woman to whom I shall say, ‘Please let down your jar that I may drink,’ and who shall say, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels’—let her be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;By&lt;/span&gt; her&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">5</a></sup> I shall know that you have shown steadfast love to my master.”</p>
<p id="p01024014_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01024015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, came out with her water jar on her shoulder. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024016-1">16&nbsp;</b>The young woman was very attractive in appearance, a maiden<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f6-1" id="fb6-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; woman of marriageable age&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">6</a></sup> whom no man had known. She went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024017-1">17&nbsp;</b>Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please give me a little water to drink from your jar.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024018-1">18&nbsp;</b>She said, “Drink, my lord.” And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand and gave him a drink. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024019-1">19&nbsp;</b>When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024020-1">20&nbsp;</b>So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew for all his camels. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024021-1">21&nbsp;</b>The man gazed at her in silence to learn whether the LORD had prospered his journey or not.</p>
<p id="p01024021_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01024022-1">22&nbsp;</b>When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f7-1" id="fb7-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;background&quot; sub-class=&quot;measurement&quot;&gt;A &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;shekel&lt;/i&gt; was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams&lt;/note&gt;">7</a></sup> and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels, <b class="verse-num" id="v01024023-1">23&nbsp;</b>and said, “Please tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024024-1">24&nbsp;</b>She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024025-1">25&nbsp;</b>She added, “We have plenty of both straw and fodder, and room to spend the night.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024026-1">26&nbsp;</b>The man bowed his head and worshiped the LORD <b class="verse-num" id="v01024027-1">27&nbsp;</b>and said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his steadfast love and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, the LORD has led me in the way to the house of my master’s kinsmen.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024028-1">28&nbsp;</b>Then the young woman ran and told her mother’s household about these things.</p>
<p id="p01024028_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01024029-1">29&nbsp;</b>Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. Laban ran out toward the man, to the spring. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024030-1">30&nbsp;</b>As soon as he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and heard the words of Rebekah his sister, “Thus the man spoke to me,” he went to the man. And behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024031-1">31&nbsp;</b>He said, “Come in, O blessed of the LORD. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024032-1">32&nbsp;</b>So the man came to the house and unharnessed the camels, and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and there was water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024033-1">33&nbsp;</b>Then food was set before him to eat. But he said, “I will not eat until I have said what I have to say.” He said, “Speak on.”</p>
<p id="p01024033_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01024034-1">34&nbsp;</b>So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024035-1">35&nbsp;</b>The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, camels and donkeys. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024036-1">36&nbsp;</b>And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old, and to him he has given all that he has. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024037-1">37&nbsp;</b>My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell, <b class="verse-num" id="v01024038-1">38&nbsp;</b>but you shall go to my father’s house and to my clan and take a wife for my son.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v01024039-1">39&nbsp;</b>I said to my master, ‘Perhaps the woman will not follow me.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v01024040-1">40&nbsp;</b>But he said to me, ‘The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father’s house. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024041-1">41&nbsp;</b>Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my clan. And if they will not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.’</p>
<p id="p01024041_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01024042-1">42&nbsp;</b>“I came today to the spring and said, ‘O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, if now you are prospering the way that I go, <b class="verse-num" id="v01024043-1">43&nbsp;</b>behold, I am standing by the spring of water. Let the virgin who comes out to draw water, to whom I shall say, “Please give me a little water from your jar to drink,” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024044-1">44&nbsp;</b>and who will say to me, “Drink, and I will draw for your camels also,” let her be the woman whom the LORD has appointed for my master’s son.’</p>
<p id="p01024044_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01024045-1">45&nbsp;</b>“Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her water jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v01024046-1">46&nbsp;</b>She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I will give your camels drink also.’ So I drank, and she gave the camels drink also. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024047-1">47&nbsp;</b>Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024048-1">48&nbsp;</b>Then I bowed my head and worshiped the LORD and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f8-1" id="fb8-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;faithfully&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">8</a></sup> to take the daughter of my master’s kinsman for his son. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024049-1">49&nbsp;</b>Now then, if you are going to show steadfast love and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.”</p>
<p id="p01024049_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01024050-1">50&nbsp;</b>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, “The thing has come from the LORD; we cannot speak to you bad or good. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024051-1">51&nbsp;</b>Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the LORD has spoken.”</p>
<p id="p01024051_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01024052-1">52&nbsp;</b>When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the earth before the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024053-1">53&nbsp;</b>And the servant brought out jewelry of silver and of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave to her brother and to her mother costly ornaments. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024054-1">54&nbsp;</b>And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they spent the night there. When they arose in the morning, he said, “Send me away to my master.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024055-1">55&nbsp;</b>Her brother and her mother said, “Let the young woman remain with us a while, at least ten days; after that she may go.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024056-1">56&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, “Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024057-1">57&nbsp;</b>They said, “Let us call the young woman and ask her.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024058-1">58&nbsp;</b>And they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will go.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01024059-1">59&nbsp;</b>So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant and his men. <b class="verse-num" id="v01024060-1">60&nbsp;</b>And they blessed Rebekah and said to her,</p>

<p id="p40017001_03-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v40017001-1">17&nbsp;</b>And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. <b class="verse-num" id="v40017002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light. <b class="verse-num" id="v40017003-1">3&nbsp;</b>And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. <b class="verse-num" id="v40017004-1">4&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40017005-1">5&nbsp;</b>He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; Son, my&lt;/i&gt; (or &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;Beloved&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40017006-1">6&nbsp;</b>When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified. <b class="verse-num" id="v40017007-1">7&nbsp;</b>But Jesus came and touched them, saying, <span class="woc">“Rise, and have no fear.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40017008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</p>
<p id="p40017008_03-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40017009-1">9&nbsp;</b>And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, <span class="woc">“Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40017010-1">10&nbsp;</b>And the disciples asked him, “Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come?” <b class="verse-num" id="v40017011-1">11&nbsp;</b>He answered, <span class="woc">“Elijah does come, and he will restore all things.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40017012-1">12&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40017013-1">13&nbsp;</b>Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.</p>

<p id="p40017013_10-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40017014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and, kneeling before him, <b class="verse-num" id="v40017015-1">15&nbsp;</b>said, “Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has seizures and he suffers terribly. For often he falls into the fire, and often into the water. <b class="verse-num" id="v40017016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40017017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And Jesus answered, <span class="woc">“O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40017018-1">18&nbsp;</b>And Jesus rebuked the demon,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Greek &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> and it<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Greek &lt;i&gt;the demon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup> came out of him, and the boy was healed instantly.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Greek &lt;i&gt;from that hour&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v40017019-1">19&nbsp;</b>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not cast it out?” <b class="verse-num" id="v40017020-1">20&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class="woc">“Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot; sub-class=&quot;variant-adds&quot;&gt;Some manuscripts insert verse 21: &lt;i&gt;But this kind never comes out except by prayer and fasting&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">5</a></sup></span></p>
<h3 id="p40017020_10-1">Jesus Again Foretells Death, Resurrection</h3>
<p id="p40017020_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40017022-1">22&nbsp;</b>As they were gathering<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f6-1" id="fb6-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot;&gt;Some manuscripts &lt;i&gt;remained&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">6</a></sup> in Galilee, Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">“The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40017023-1">23&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day.”</span> And they were greatly distressed.</p>

From their sons or from others?”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40017026-1">26&nbsp;</b>And when he said, “From others,” Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">“Then the sons are free.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40017027-1">27&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f7-1" id="fb7-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Greek &lt;i language=&quot;Greek&quot;&gt;stater&lt;/i&gt;, a silver coin worth four drachmas or approximately one shekel&lt;/note&gt;">7</a></sup> Take that and give it to them for me and for yourself.”</span></p>
