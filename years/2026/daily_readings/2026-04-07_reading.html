<p class="starts-chapter" id="p06004001_07-1"><b class="chapter-num" id="v06004001-1">4 </b>When all the nation had finished passing over the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua, <b class="verse-num" id="v06004002-1">2 </b>“Take twelve men from the people, from each tribe a man, <b class="verse-num" id="v06004003-1">3 </b>and command them, saying, ‘Take twelve stones from here out of the midst of the Jordan, from the very place where the priests’ feet stood firmly, and bring them over with you and lay them down in the place where you lodge tonight.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v06004004-1">4 </b>Then Joshua called the twelve men from the people of Israel, whom he had appointed, a man from each tribe. <b class="verse-num" id="v06004005-1">5 </b>And Joshua said to them, “Pass on before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take up each of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel, <b class="verse-num" id="v06004006-1">6 </b>that this may be a sign among you. When your children ask in time to come, ‘What do those stones mean to you?’ <b class="verse-num" id="v06004007-1">7 </b>then you shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. So these stones shall be to the people of Israel a memorial forever.”</p>
<p id="p06004007_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06004008-1">8 </b>And the people of Israel did just as Joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel, just as the LORD told Joshua. And they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged and laid them down<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title='&lt;note class="alternative"&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;to rest&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>1</a></sup> there. <b class="verse-num" id="v06004009-1">9 </b>And Joshua set up<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title='&lt;note class="alternative"&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="catch-word"&gt;Joshua&lt;/span&gt; had set up&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>2</a></sup> twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there to this day. <b class="verse-num" id="v06004010-1">10 </b>For the priests bearing the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to tell the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua.</p>
<p id="p06004010_07-1">The people passed over in haste. <b class="verse-num" id="v06004011-1">11 </b>And when all the people had finished passing over, the ark of the LORD and the priests passed over before the people. <b class="verse-num" id="v06004012-1">12 </b>The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh passed over armed before the people of Israel, as Moses had told them. <b class="verse-num" id="v06004013-1">13 </b>About 40,000 ready for war passed over before the LORD for battle, to the plains of Jericho. <b class="verse-num" id="v06004014-1">14 </b>On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they stood in awe of him just as they had stood in awe of Moses, all the days of his life.</p>
<p id="p06004014_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06004015-1">15 </b>And the LORD said to Joshua, <b class="verse-num" id="v06004016-1">16 </b>“Command the priests bearing the ark of the testimony to come up out of the Jordan.” <b class="verse-num" id="v06004017-1">17 </b>So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up out of the Jordan.” <b class="verse-num" id="v06004018-1">18 </b>And when the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up on dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks, as before.</p>
<p id="p06004018_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06004019-1">19 </b>The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they encamped at Gilgal on the east border of Jericho. <b class="verse-num" id="v06004020-1">20 </b>And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal. <b class="verse-num" id="v06004021-1">21 </b>And he said to the people of Israel, “When your children ask their fathers in times to come, ‘What do these stones mean?’ <b class="verse-num" id="v06004022-1">22 </b>then you shall let your children know, ‘Israel passed over this Jordan on dry ground.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v06004023-1">23 </b>For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up for us until we passed over, <b class="verse-num" id="v06004024-1">24 </b>so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, that you may fear the LORD your God forever.”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title='&lt;note class="alternative"&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;all the days&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>3</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="p06005001_07-1">The New Generation Circumcised</h3>
<p class="starts-chapter" id="p06005001_11-1"><b class="chapter-num" id="v06005001-1">5 </b>As soon as all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the people of Israel until they had crossed over, their hearts melted and there was no longer any spirit in them because of the people of Israel.</p>
<p id="p06005001_11-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06005002-1">2 </b>At that time the LORD said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel a second time.” <b class="verse-num" id="v06005003-1">3 </b>So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title='&lt;note class="explanation" sub-class="name-meaning"&gt;&lt;i class="catch-word"&gt;Gibeath-haaraloth&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;the hill of the foreskins&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>4</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v06005004-1">4 </b>And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way after they had come out of Egypt. <b class="verse-num" id="v06005005-1">5 </b>Though all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the people who were born on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised. <b class="verse-num" id="v06005006-1">6 </b>For the people of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished, because they did not obey the voice of the LORD; the LORD swore to them that he would not let them see the land that the LORD had sworn to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey. <b class="verse-num" id="v06005007-1">7 </b>So it was their children, whom he raised up in their place, that Joshua circumcised. For they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.</p>
<p id="p06005007_11-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06005008-1">8 </b>When the circumcising of the whole nation was finished, they remained in their places in the camp until they were healed. <b class="verse-num" id="v06005009-1">9 </b>And the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” And so the name of that place is called Gilgal<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title='&lt;note class="explanation" sub-class="name-meaning"&gt;&lt;i class="catch-word"&gt;Gilgal&lt;/i&gt; sounds like the Hebrew for &lt;i&gt;to roll&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>5</a></sup> to this day.</p>
<h3 id="p06005009_11-1">First Passover in Canaan</h3>
<p id="p06005009_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06005010-1">10 </b>While the people of Israel were encamped at Gilgal, they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho. <b class="verse-num" id="v06005011-1">11 </b>And the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain. <b class="verse-num" id="v06005012-1">12 </b>And the manna ceased the day after they ate of the produce of the land. And there was no longer manna for the people of Israel, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</p>
<h3 id="p06005012_15-1">The Commander of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s Army</h3>
<p id="p06005012_21-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06005013-1">13 </b>When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing before him with his drawn sword in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our adversaries?” <b class="verse-num" id="v06005014-1">14 </b>And he said, “No; but I am the commander of the army of the LORD. Now I have come.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f6-1" id="fb6-1" title='&lt;note class="variant"&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;and paid homage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>6</a></sup> and said to him, “What does my lord say to his servant?” <b class="verse-num" id="v06005015-1">15 </b>And the commander of the LORD’s army said to Joshua, “Take off your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.</p>
<h3 id="p06006001_21-1">The Fall of Jericho</h3>
<p class="starts-chapter" id="p06006001_25-1"><b class="chapter-num" id="v06006001-1">6 </b>Now Jericho was shut up inside and outside because of the people of Israel. None went out, and none came in. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006002-1">2 </b>And the LORD said to Joshua, “See, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and mighty men of valor. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006003-1">3 </b>You shall march around the city, all the men of war going around the city once. Thus shall you do for six days. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006004-1">4 </b>Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006005-1">5 </b>And when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, when you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout, and the wall of the city will fall down flat,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f7-1" id="fb7-1" title='&lt;note class="translation" sub-class="original"&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;under itself&lt;/i&gt;; also verse 20&lt;/note&gt;'>7</a></sup> and the people shall go up, everyone straight before him.” <b class="verse-num" id="v06006006-1">6 </b>So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.” <b class="verse-num" id="v06006007-1">7 </b>And he said to the people, “Go forward. March around the city and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the LORD.”</p>
<p id="p06006007_25-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06006008-1">8 </b>And just as Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the LORD went forward, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD following them. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006009-1">9 </b>The armed men were walking before the priests who were blowing the trumpets, and the rear guard was walking after the ark, while the trumpets blew continually. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006010-1">10 </b>But Joshua commanded the people, “You shall not shout or make your voice heard, neither shall any word go out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.” <b class="verse-num" id="v06006011-1">11 </b>So he caused the ark of the LORD to circle the city, going about it once. And they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.</p>
<p id="p06006011_25-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06006012-1">12 </b>Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006013-1">13 </b>And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD walked on, and they blew the trumpets continually. And the armed men were walking before them, and the rear guard was walking after the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets blew continually. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006014-1">14 </b>And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did for six days.</p>
<p id="p06006014_25-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06006015-1">15 </b>On the seventh day they rose early, at the dawn of day, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times. It was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006016-1">16 </b>And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout, for the LORD has given you the city. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006017-1">17 </b>And the city and all that is within it shall be devoted to the LORD for destruction.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f8-1" id="fb8-1" title='&lt;note class="explanation" sub-class="devote-to-destruction"&gt;That is, set apart (&lt;span class="catch-word"&gt;devoted&lt;/span&gt;) as an offering to the Lord (for destruction); also verses 18, 21&lt;/note&gt;'>8</a></sup> Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006018-1">18 </b>But you, keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted them you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel a thing for destruction and bring trouble upon it. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006019-1">19 </b>But all silver and gold, and every vessel of bronze and iron, are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD.” <b class="verse-num" id="v06006020-1">20 </b>So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006021-1">21 </b>Then they devoted all in the city to destruction, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys, with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p id="p06006021_25-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06006022-1">22 </b>But to the two men who had spied out the land, Joshua said, “Go into the prostitute’s house and bring out from there the woman and all who belong to her, as you swore to her.” <b class="verse-num" id="v06006023-1">23 </b>So the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. And they brought all her relatives and put them outside the camp of Israel. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006024-1">24 </b>And they burned the city with fire, and everything in it. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v06006025-1">25 </b>But Rahab the prostitute and her father’s household and all who belonged to her, Joshua saved alive. And she has lived in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</p>
<p id="p06006025_25-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v06006026-1">26 </b>Joshua laid an oath on them at that time, saying, “Cursed before the LORD be the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho.</p>

Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah”—not knowing what he said. <b class="verse-num" id="v42009034-1">34 </b>As he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. <b class="verse-num" id="v42009035-1">35 </b>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen One;<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title='&lt;note class="variant"&gt;Some manuscripts &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="catch-word"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; Beloved&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>2</a></sup> listen to him!” <b class="verse-num" id="v42009036-1">36 </b>And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.</p>
