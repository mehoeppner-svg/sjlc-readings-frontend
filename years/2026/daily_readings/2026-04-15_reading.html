<p id="p07004001_04-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v07004001-1">4&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD after Ehud died. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD for help, for he had 900 chariots of iron and he oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for twenty years.</p>
<p id="p07004003_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v07004004-1">4&nbsp;</b>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004005-1">5&nbsp;</b>She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004006-1">6&nbsp;</b>She sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali and said to him, “Has not the LORD, the God of Israel, commanded you, ‘Go, gather your men at Mount Tabor, taking 10,000 from the people of Naphtali and the people of Zebulun. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004007-1">7&nbsp;</b>And I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin’s army, to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops, and I will give him into your hand’?” <b class="verse-num" id="v07004008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go.” <b class="verse-num" id="v07004009-1">9&nbsp;</b>And she said, “I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.” Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004010-1">10&nbsp;</b>And Barak called out Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh. And 10,000 men went up at his heels, and Deborah went up with him.</p>
<p id="p07004010_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v07004011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.</p>
<p id="p07004011_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v07004012-1">12&nbsp;</b>When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor, <b class="verse-num" id="v07004013-1">13&nbsp;</b>Sisera called out all his chariots, 900 chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And Deborah said to Barak, “Up! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hand. Does not the LORD go out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004015-1">15&nbsp;</b>And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak by the edge of the sword. And Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.</p>
<p id="p07004016_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v07004017-1">17&nbsp;</b>But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004018-1">18&nbsp;</b>And Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me; do not be afraid.” So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And he said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004020-1">20&nbsp;</b>And he said to her, “Stand at the opening of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, ‘Is anyone here?’ say, ‘No.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v07004021-1">21&nbsp;</b>But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand. Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until it went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004022-1">22&nbsp;</b>And behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” So he went in to her tent, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg in his temple.</p>
<p id="p07004022_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v07004023-1">23&nbsp;</b>So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel. <b class="verse-num" id="v07004024-1">24&nbsp;</b>And the hand of the people of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</p>

Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.” <b class="verse-num" id="v07006016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to him, “But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.” <b class="verse-num" id="v07006017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me. <b class="verse-num" id="v07006018-1">18&nbsp;</b>Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you.” And he said, “I will stay till you return.”</p>
<p id="p07006018_17-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v07006019-1">19&nbsp;</b>So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f7-1" id="fb7-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;background&quot; sub-class=&quot;measurement&quot;&gt;An &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;ephah&lt;/i&gt; was about 3/5 bushel or 22 liters&lt;/note&gt;">7</a></sup> of flour.

And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight. <b class="verse-num" id="v07006022-1">22&nbsp;</b>Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the LORD. And Gideon said, “Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.” <b class="verse-num" id="v07006023-1">23&nbsp;</b>But the LORD said to him, “Peace be to you.

<p id="p07006024_17-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v07006025-1">25&nbsp;</b>That night the LORD said to him, “Take your father’s bull, and the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it <b class="verse-num" id="v07006026-1">26&nbsp;</b>and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down.” <b class="verse-num" id="v07006027-1">27&nbsp;</b>So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had told him.

<p id="p07006032_23-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v07006033-1">33&nbsp;</b>Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. <b class="verse-num" id="v07006034-1">34&nbsp;</b>But the Spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him. <b class="verse-num" id="v07006035-1">35&nbsp;</b>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him.

<p id="p07006035_28-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v07006036-1">36&nbsp;</b>Then Gideon said to God, “If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said, <b class="verse-num" id="v07006037-1">37&nbsp;</b>behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.” <b class="verse-num" id="v07006038-1">38&nbsp;</b>And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water. <b class="verse-num" id="v07006039-1">39&nbsp;</b>Then Gideon said to God, “Let not your anger burn against me; let me speak just once more. Please let me test just once more with the fleece.
