<h3 id="p41012012_06-1">Paying Taxes to Caesar</h3>
<p id="p41012012_10-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v41012013-1">13&nbsp;</b>And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to trap him in his talk. <b class="verse-num" id="v41012014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And they came and said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone’s opinion. For you are not swayed by appearances,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Greek &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; do not look at people’s faces&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup> but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?” <b class="verse-num" id="v41012015-1">15&nbsp;</b>But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, <span class="woc">“Why put me to the test? Bring me a denarius<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;background&quot; sub-class=&quot;measurement&quot;&gt;A &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;denarius&lt;/i&gt; was a day’s wage for a laborer&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> and let me look at it.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v41012016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And they brought one. And he said to them, <span class="woc">“Whose likeness and inscription is this?”</span> They said to him, “Caesar’s.” <b class="verse-num" id="v41012017-1">17&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">“Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</span> And they marveled at him.</p>
<h3 id="p41012017_10-1">The Sadducees Ask About the Resurrection</h3>
<p id="p41012017_16-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v41012018-1">18&nbsp;</b>And Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection. And they asked him a question, saying, <b class="verse-num" id="v41012019-1">19&nbsp;</b>“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Greek &lt;i&gt;his brother&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">5</a></sup> must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. <b class="verse-num" id="v41012020-1">20&nbsp;</b>There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no offspring. <b class="verse-num" id="v41012021-1">21&nbsp;</b>And the second took her, and died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise. <b class="verse-num" id="v41012022-1">22&nbsp;</b>And the seven left no offspring. Last of all the woman also died. <b class="verse-num" id="v41012023-1">23&nbsp;</b>In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.”</p>
<p id="p41012023_16-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v41012024-1">24&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">“Is this not the reason you are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v41012025-1">25&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v41012026-1">26&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v41012027-1">27&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are quite wrong.”</span></p>
