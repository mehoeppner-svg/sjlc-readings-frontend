Let me only pass through on foot, nothing more.” <b class="verse-num" id="v04020020-1">20 </b>But he said, “You shall not pass through.” And Edom came out against them with a large army and with a strong force. <b class="verse-num" id="v04020021-1">21 </b>Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory, so Israel turned away from him.</p>

And they went up Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. <b class="verse-num" id="v04020028-1">28 </b>And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son. And Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. <b class="verse-num" id="v04020029-1">29 </b>And when all the congregation saw that Aaron had perished, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.</p>

<p id="p04021003_25-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v04021004-1">4 </b>From Mount Hor they set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. And the people became impatient on the way. <b class="verse-num" id="v04021005-1">5 </b>And the people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food.” <b class="verse-num" id="v04021006-1">6 </b>Then the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died. <b class="verse-num" id="v04021007-1">7 </b>And the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you. Pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. <b class="verse-num" id="v04021008-1">8 </b>And the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.” <b class="verse-num" id="v04021009-1">9 </b>So Moses made a bronze<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title='&lt;note class="alternative"&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;copper&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>4</a></sup> serpent and set it on a pole.

So he struck her again. <b class="verse-num" id="v04022026-1">26 </b>Then the angel of the LORD went ahead and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left. <b class="verse-num" id="v04022027-1">27 </b>When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam. And Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff. <b class="verse-num" id="v04022028-1">28 </b>Then the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?” <b class="verse-num" id="v04022029-1">29 </b>And Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have made a fool of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, for then I would kill you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v04022030-1">30 </b>And the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Is it my habit to treat you this way?” And he said, “No.”</p>
<p id="p04022030_44-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v04022031-1">31 </b>Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, with his drawn sword in his hand. And he bowed down and fell on his face. <b class="verse-num" id="v04022032-1">32 </b>And the angel of the LORD said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times?

Now therefore, if it is evil in your sight, I will turn back.” <b class="verse-num" id="v04022035-1">35 </b>And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only the word that I tell you.” So Balaam went on with the princes of Balak.</p>
<p id="p04022035_44-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v04022036-1">36 </b>When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, on the border formed by the Arnon, at the extremity of the border. <b class="verse-num" id="v04022037-1">37 </b>And Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to honor you?” <b class="verse-num" id="v04022038-1">38 </b>Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you! Have I now any power of my own to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that must I speak.” <b class="verse-num" id="v04022039-1">39 </b>Then Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth. <b class="verse-num" id="v04022040-1">40 </b>And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent for Balaam and for the princes who were with him.</p>
<p id="p04022040_44-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v04022041-1">41 </b>And in the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal, and from there he saw a fraction of the people.</p>
