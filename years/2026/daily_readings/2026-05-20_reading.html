<p id="p10024009_17-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10024010-1">10 </b>But David’s heart struck him after he had numbered the people. And David said to the LORD, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O LORD, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have done very foolishly.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10024011-1">11 </b>And when David arose in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying, <b class="verse-num" id="v10024012-1">12 </b>“Go and say to David, ‘Thus says the LORD, Three things I offer<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f18-1" id="fb18-1" title='&lt;note class="alternative"&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;hold over&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>18</a></sup> you.

<p id="p10024014_17-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10024015-1">15 </b>So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning until the appointed time.

And Araunah went out and paid homage to the king with his face to the ground. <b class="verse-num" id="v10024021-1">21 </b>And Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” David said, “To buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be averted from the people.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10024022-1">22 </b>Then Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Here are the oxen for the burnt offering and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood. <b class="verse-num" id="v10024023-1">23 </b>All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king.” And Araunah said to the king, “May the LORD your God accept you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10024024-1">24 </b>But the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f20-1" id="fb20-1" title='&lt;note class="background" sub-class="measurement"&gt;A &lt;i class="catch-word-plural"&gt;shekel&lt;/i&gt; was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams&lt;/note&gt;'>20</a></sup> of silver. <b class="verse-num" id="v10024025-1">25 </b>And David built there an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
