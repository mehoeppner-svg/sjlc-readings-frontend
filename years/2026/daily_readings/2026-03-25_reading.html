(All that portion of Bashan is called the land of Rephaim. <b class="verse-num" id="v05003014-1">14&nbsp;</b>Jair the Manassite took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called the villages after his own name, Havvoth-jair, as it is to this day.) <b class="verse-num" id="v05003015-1">15&nbsp;</b>To Machir I gave Gilead, <b class="verse-num" id="v05003016-1">16&nbsp;</b>and to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a border, as far over as the river Jabbok, the border of the Ammonites; <b class="verse-num" id="v05003017-1">17&nbsp;</b>the Arabah also, with the Jordan as the border, from Chinnereth as far as the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east.</p>
<p id="p05003017_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v05003018-1">18&nbsp;</b>“And I commanded you at that time, saying, ‘The LORD your God has given you this land to possess.

Then each of you may return to his possession which I have given you.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v05003021-1">21&nbsp;</b>And I commanded Joshua at that time, ‘Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. So will the LORD do to all the kingdoms into which you are crossing. <b class="verse-num" id="v05003022-1">22&nbsp;</b>You shall not fear them, for it is the LORD your God who fights for you.’</p>

<p id="p05003022_12-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v05003023-1">23&nbsp;</b>“And I pleaded with the LORD at that time, saying, <b class="verse-num" id="v05003024-1">24&nbsp;</b>‘O Lord GOD, you have only begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as yours? <b class="verse-num" id="v05003025-1">25&nbsp;</b>Please let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, that good hill country and Lebanon.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v05003026-1">26&nbsp;</b>But the LORD was angry with me because of you and would not listen to me. And the LORD said to me, ‘Enough from you; do not speak to me of this matter again. <b class="verse-num" id="v05003027-1">27&nbsp;</b>Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and look at it with your eyes, for you shall not go over this Jordan. <b class="verse-num" id="v05003028-1">28&nbsp;</b>But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he shall go over at the head of this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land that you shall see.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v05003029-1">29&nbsp;</b>So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-peor.</p>
