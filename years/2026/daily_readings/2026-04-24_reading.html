<h3 id="p09004001_01-1">The Philistines Capture the Ark</h3>
<p id="p09004001_06-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v09004001-1">4&nbsp;</b>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.</p>
<p id="p09004001_06-1">Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines. They encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek. <b class="verse-num" id="v09004002-1">2&nbsp;</b>The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle spread, Israel was defeated before the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the field of battle. <b class="verse-num" id="v09004003-1">3&nbsp;</b>And when the people came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD here from Shiloh, that it<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09004004-1">4&nbsp;</b>So the people sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
<p id="p09004004_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09004005-1">5&nbsp;</b>As soon as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded. <b class="verse-num" id="v09004006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, “What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” And when they learned that the ark of the LORD had come to the camp, <b class="verse-num" id="v09004007-1">7&nbsp;</b>the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “A god has come into the camp.” And they said, “Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before. <b class="verse-num" id="v09004008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness. <b class="verse-num" id="v09004009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, lest you become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; be men and fight.”</p>
<p id="p09004009_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09004010-1">10&nbsp;</b>So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and they fled, every man to his home. And there was a very great slaughter, for thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell. <b class="verse-num" id="v09004011-1">11&nbsp;</b>And the ark of God was captured, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.</p>
<h3 id="p09004011_06-1">The Death of Eli</h3>
<p id="p09004011_10-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09004012-1">12&nbsp;</b>A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head. <b class="verse-num" id="v09004013-1">13&nbsp;</b>When he arrived, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out. <b class="verse-num" id="v09004014-1">14&nbsp;</b>When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, “What is this uproar?” Then the man hurried and came and told Eli. <b class="verse-num" id="v09004015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes were set so that he could not see. <b class="verse-num" id="v09004016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And the man said to Eli, “I am he who has come from the battle; I fled from the battle today.” And he said, “How did it go, my son?” <b class="verse-num" id="v09004017-1">17&nbsp;</b>He who brought the news answered and said, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great defeat among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09004018-1">18&nbsp;</b>As soon as he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell over backward from his seat by the side of the gate, and his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.</p>
<p id="p09004018_10-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09004019-1">19&nbsp;</b>Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant, about to give birth. And when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed and gave birth, for her pains came upon her. <b class="verse-num" id="v09004020-1">20&nbsp;</b>And about the time of her death the women attending her said to her, “Do not be afraid, for you have borne a son.” But she did not answer or pay attention. <b class="verse-num" id="v09004021-1">21&nbsp;</b>And she named the child Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;gone into exile&lt;/i&gt;; also verse 22&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> from Israel!” because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband. <b class="verse-num" id="v09004022-1">22&nbsp;</b>And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”</p>
<h3 id="p09005001_10-1">The Philistines and the Ark</h3>
<p id="p09005001_15-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v09005001-1">5&nbsp;</b>When the Philistines captured the ark of God, they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. <b class="verse-num" id="v09005002-1">2&nbsp;</b>Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it up beside Dagon. <b class="verse-num" id="v09005003-1">3&nbsp;</b>And when the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and put him back in his place. <b class="verse-num" id="v09005004-1">4&nbsp;</b>But when they rose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD, and the head of Dagon and both his hands were lying cut off on the threshold. Only the trunk of Dagon was left to him. <b class="verse-num" id="v09005005-1">5&nbsp;</b>This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.</p>
<p id="p09005005_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09005006-1">6&nbsp;</b>The hand of the LORD was heavy against the people of Ashdod, and he terrified and afflicted them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territory. <b class="verse-num" id="v09005007-1">7&nbsp;</b>And when the men of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for his hand is hard against us and against Dagon our god.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09005008-1">8&nbsp;</b>So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.” So they brought the ark of the God of Israel there. <b class="verse-num" id="v09005009-1">9&nbsp;</b>But after they had brought it around, the hand of the LORD was against the city, causing a very great panic, and he afflicted the men of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out on them. <b class="verse-num" id="v09005010-1">10&nbsp;</b>So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But as soon as the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, “They have brought around to us the ark of the God of Israel to kill us and our people.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09005011-1">11&nbsp;</b>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, that it may not kill us and our people.” For there was a deathly panic throughout the whole city. The hand of God was very heavy there. <b class="verse-num" id="v09005012-1">12&nbsp;</b>The men who did not die were struck with tumors, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</p>
<h3 id="p09006001_15-1">The Ark Returned to Israel</h3>
<p id="p09006001_20-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v09006001-1">6&nbsp;</b>The ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months. <b class="verse-num" id="v09006002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us with what we shall send it to its place.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09006003-1">3&nbsp;</b>They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand does not turn away from you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09006004-1">4&nbsp;</b>And they said, “What is the guilt offering that we shall return to him?” They answered, “Five golden tumors and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, for the same plague was on all of you and on your lords. <b class="verse-num" id="v09006005-1">5&nbsp;</b>So you must make images of your tumors and images of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you and your gods and your land. <b class="verse-num" id="v09006006-1">6&nbsp;</b>Why should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After he had dealt severely with them, did they not send the people away, and they departed? <b class="verse-num" id="v09006007-1">7&nbsp;</b>Now then, take and prepare a new cart and two milk cows on which there has never come a yoke, and yoke the cows to the cart, but take their calves home, away from them. <b class="verse-num" id="v09006008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And take the ark of the LORD and place it on the cart and put in a box at its side the figures of gold, which you are returning to him as a guilt offering. Then send it off and let it go its way <b class="verse-num" id="v09006009-1">9&nbsp;</b>and watch. If it goes up on the way to its own land, to Beth-shemesh, then it is he who has done us this great harm, but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us; it happened to us by coincidence.”</p>
<p id="p09006009_20-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09006010-1">10&nbsp;</b>The men did so, and took two milk cows and yoked them to the cart and shut up their calves at home. <b class="verse-num" id="v09006011-1">11&nbsp;</b>And they put the ark of the LORD on the cart and the box with the golden mice and the images of their tumors. <b class="verse-num" id="v09006012-1">12&nbsp;</b>And the cows went straight in the direction of Beth-shemesh along one highway, lowing as they went. They turned neither to the right nor to the left, and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh. <b class="verse-num" id="v09006013-1">13&nbsp;</b>Now the people of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley. And when they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, they rejoiced to see it. <b class="verse-num" id="v09006014-1">14&nbsp;</b>The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there. A great stone was there. And they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v09006015-1">15&nbsp;</b>And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD and the box that was beside it, in which were the golden figures, and set them upon the great stone. And the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices on that day to the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v09006016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And when the five lords of the Philistines saw it, they returned that day to Ekron.</p>
<p id="p09006016_20-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09006017-1">17&nbsp;</b>These are the golden tumors that the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron, <b class="verse-num" id="v09006018-1">18&nbsp;</b>and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and unwalled villages. The great stone beside which they set down the ark of the LORD is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.</p>
<p id="p09006018_20-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09006019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And he struck some of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they looked upon the ark of the LORD. He struck seventy men of them,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Most Hebrew manuscripts &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;struck&lt;/span&gt; of the people seventy men, fifty thousand men&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup> and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great blow. <b class="verse-num" id="v09006020-1">20&nbsp;</b>Then the men of Beth-shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom shall he go up away from us?” <b class="verse-num" id="v09006021-1">21&nbsp;</b>So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to you.”</p>

<h3 id="p42018001_01-1">The Parable of the Persistent Widow</h3>
<p id="p42018001_07-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v42018001-1">18&nbsp;</b>And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart. <b class="verse-num" id="v42018002-1">2&nbsp;</b>He said, <span class="woc">“In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42018003-1">3&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42018004-1">4&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man,</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42018005-1">5&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.’”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v42018006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And the Lord said, <span class="woc">“Hear what the unrighteous judge says.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42018007-1">7&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">And will not God give justice to his elect, who cry to him day and night?

Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”</span></p>
<h3 id="p42018008_07-1">The Pharisee and the Tax Collector</h3>
<p id="p42018008_13-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v42018009-1">9&nbsp;</b>He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt: <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42018010-1">10&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">“Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42018011-1">11&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;standing&lt;/span&gt;, prayed to himself&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> thus: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42018012-1">12&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42018013-1">13&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42018014-1">14&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span></p>
<h3 id="p42018014_13-1">Let the Children Come to Me</h3>
<p id="p42018014_19-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v42018015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. <b class="verse-num" id="v42018016-1">16&nbsp;</b>But Jesus called them to him, saying, <span class="woc">“Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42018017-1">17&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.”</span></p>

<p id="p42018017_22-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v42018018-1">18&nbsp;</b>And a ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” <b class="verse-num" id="v42018019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">“Why do you call me good?
