<h3 id="p10016004_04-1">Shimei Curses David</h3>
<p id="p10016004_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10016005-1">5&nbsp;</b>When King David came to Bahurim, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera, and as he came he cursed continually. <b class="verse-num" id="v10016006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David, and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. <b class="verse-num" id="v10016007-1">7&nbsp;</b>And Shimei said as he cursed, “Get out, get out, you man of blood, you worthless man! <b class="verse-num" id="v10016008-1">8&nbsp;</b>The LORD has avenged on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned, and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, your evil is on you, for you are a man of blood.”</p>
<p id="p10016008_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10016009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10016010-1">10&nbsp;</b>But the king said, “What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD has said to him, ‘Curse David,’ who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’” <b class="verse-num" id="v10016011-1">11&nbsp;</b>And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Behold, my own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Leave him alone, and let him curse, for the LORD has told him to. <b class="verse-num" id="v10016012-1">12&nbsp;</b>It may be that the LORD will look on the wrong done to me,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot;&gt;Septuagint, Vulgate &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;will look&lt;/span&gt; upon my affliction&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> and that the LORD will repay me with good for his cursing today.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10016013-1">13&nbsp;</b>So David and his men went on the road, while Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and flung dust. <b class="verse-num" id="v10016014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And the king, and all the people who were with him, arrived weary at the Jordan.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot; sub-class=&quot;variant-lacks&quot;&gt;Septuagint; Hebrew lacks &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;at the Jordan&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> And there he refreshed himself.</p>
<h3 id="p10016014_07-1">Absalom Enters Jerusalem</h3>
<p id="p10016014_10-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10016015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. <b class="verse-num" id="v10016016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!” <b class="verse-num" id="v10016017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?” <b class="verse-num" id="v10016018-1">18&nbsp;</b>And Hushai said to Absalom, “No, for whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I will be, and with him I will remain. <b class="verse-num" id="v10016019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And again, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? As I have served your father, so I will serve you.”</p>
<p id="p10016019_10-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10016020-1">20&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give your counsel. What shall we do?” <b class="verse-num" id="v10016021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines, whom he has left to keep the house, and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father, and the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10016022-1">22&nbsp;</b>So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof. And Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel. <b class="verse-num" id="v10016023-1">23&nbsp;</b>Now in those days the counsel that Ahithophel gave was as if one consulted the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel esteemed, both by David and by Absalom.</p>
<h3 id="p10017001_10-1">Hushai Saves David</h3>
<p id="p10017001_13-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v10017001-1">17&nbsp;</b>Moreover, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight. <b class="verse-num" id="v10017002-1">2&nbsp;</b>I will come upon him while he is weary and discouraged and throw him into a panic, and all the people who are with him will flee. I will strike down only the king, <b class="verse-num" id="v10017003-1">3&nbsp;</b>and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride comes home to her husband. You seek the life of only one man,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot;&gt;Septuagint; Hebrew &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;back to you&lt;/span&gt;.

<p id="p10017004_13-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10017005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom said, “Call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10017006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him, “Thus has Ahithophel spoken; shall we do as he says? If not, you speak.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10017007-1">7&nbsp;</b>Then Hushai said to Absalom, “This time the counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10017008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Hushai said, “You know that your father and his men are mighty men, and that they are enraged,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;bitter of soul&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Besides, your father is expert in war; he will not spend the night with the people. <b class="verse-num" id="v10017009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Behold, even now he has hidden himself in one of the pits or in some other place. And as soon as some of the people fall<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;And as&lt;/span&gt; he falls on them&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">5</a></sup> at the first attack, whoever hears it will say, ‘There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v10017010-1">10&nbsp;</b>Then even the valiant man, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will utterly melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and that those who are with him are valiant men. <b class="verse-num" id="v10017011-1">11&nbsp;</b>But my counsel is that all Israel be gathered to you, from Dan to Beersheba, as the sand by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person. <b class="verse-num" id="v10017012-1">12&nbsp;</b>So we shall come upon him in some place where he is to be found, and we shall light upon him as the dew falls on the ground, and of him and all the men with him not one will be left. <b class="verse-num" id="v10017013-1">13&nbsp;</b>If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we shall drag it into the valley, until not even a pebble is to be found there.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10017014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For the LORD had ordained<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f6-1" id="fb6-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;commanded&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">6</a></sup> to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, so that the LORD might bring harm upon Absalom.</p>
<p id="p10017014_13-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10017015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, “Thus and so did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so have I counseled. <b class="verse-num" id="v10017016-1">16&nbsp;</b>Now therefore send quickly and tell David, ‘Do not stay tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over, lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v10017017-1">17&nbsp;</b>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting at En-rogel. A female servant was to go and tell them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they were not to be seen entering the city. <b class="verse-num" id="v10017018-1">18&nbsp;</b>But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So both of them went away quickly and came to the house of a man at Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard. And they went down into it. <b class="verse-num" id="v10017019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth and scattered grain on it, and nothing was known of it. <b class="verse-num" id="v10017020-1">20&nbsp;</b>When Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house, they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” And the woman said to them, “They have gone over the brook<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f7-1" id="fb7-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;meaning-uncertain&quot;&gt;The meaning of the Hebrew word is uncertain&lt;/note&gt;">7</a></sup> of water.” And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p10017020_13-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10017021-1">21&nbsp;</b>After they had gone, the men came up out of the well, and went and told King David. They said to David, “Arise, and go quickly over the water, for thus and so has Ahithophel counseled against you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10017022-1">22&nbsp;</b>Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed the Jordan. By daybreak not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.</p>
<p id="p10017022_13-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10017023-1">23&nbsp;</b>When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey and went off home to his own city. He set his house in order and hanged himself, and he died and was buried in the tomb of his father.</p>
<p id="p10017023_13-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10017024-1">24&nbsp;</b>Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel. <b class="verse-num" id="v10017025-1">25&nbsp;</b>Now Absalom had set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f8-1" id="fb8-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;compare-verse&quot;&gt;Compare 1 Chronicles 2:17; Hebrew &lt;i&gt;Israelite&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">8</a></sup> who had married Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother. <b class="verse-num" id="v10017026-1">26&nbsp;</b>And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</p>
<p id="p10017026_13-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10017027-1">27&nbsp;</b>When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim, <b class="verse-num" id="v10017028-1">28&nbsp;</b>brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, wheat, barley, flour, parched grain, beans and lentils,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f9-1" id="fb9-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew adds &lt;i&gt;and parched grain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">9</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v10017029-1">29&nbsp;</b>honey and curds and sheep and cheese from the herd, for David and the people with him to eat, for they said, “The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.”</p>

<p id="p10018001_15-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v10018001-1">18&nbsp;</b>Then David mustered the men who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. <b class="verse-num" id="v10018002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And David sent out the army, one third under the command of Joab, one third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and one third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the men, “I myself will also go out with you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10018003-1">3&nbsp;</b>But the men said, “You shall not go out. For if we flee, they will not care about us. If half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. Therefore it is better that you send us help from the city.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10018004-1">4&nbsp;</b>The king said to them, “Whatever seems best to you I will do.” So the king stood at the side of the gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands. <b class="verse-num" id="v10018005-1">5&nbsp;</b>And the king ordered Joab and Abishai and Ittai, “Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.” And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders about Absalom.</p>
<p id="p10018005_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10018006-1">6&nbsp;</b>So the army went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim. <b class="verse-num" id="v10018007-1">7&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David, and the loss there was great on that day, twenty thousand men. <b class="verse-num" id="v10018008-1">8&nbsp;</b>The battle spread over the face of all the country, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword.</p>
<p id="p10018008_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10018009-1">9&nbsp;</b>And Absalom happened to meet the servants of David.

Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10018012-1">12&nbsp;</b>But the man said to Joab, “Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver, I would not reach out my hand against the king’s son, for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘For my sake protect the young man Absalom.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v10018013-1">13&nbsp;</b>On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously against his life<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f11-1" id="fb11-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;at the risk of my life&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">11</a></sup> (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10018014-1">14&nbsp;</b>Joab said, “I will not waste time like this with you.” And he took three javelins in his hand and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the oak. <b class="verse-num" id="v10018015-1">15&nbsp;</b>And ten young men, Joab’s armor-bearers, surrounded Absalom and struck him and killed him.</p>
<p id="p10018015_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10018016-1">16&nbsp;</b>Then Joab blew the trumpet, and the troops came back from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained them. <b class="verse-num" id="v10018017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And they took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest and raised over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled every one to his own home. <b class="verse-num" id="v10018018-1">18&nbsp;</b>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself the pillar that is in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.” He called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Absalom’s monument<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f12-1" id="fb12-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;Absalom’s hand&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">12</a></sup> to this day.</p>

And the king said, “If he is alone, there is news in his mouth.” And he drew nearer and nearer. <b class="verse-num" id="v10018026-1">26&nbsp;</b>The watchman saw another man running. And the watchman called to the gate and said, “See, another man running alone!” The king said, “He also brings news.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10018027-1">27&nbsp;</b>The watchman said, “I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” And the king said, “He is a good man and comes with good news.”</p>
<p id="p10018027_20-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10018028-1">28&nbsp;</b>Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, “All is well.” And he bowed before the king with his face to the earth and said, “Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10018029-1">29&nbsp;</b>And the king said, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, your servant, I saw a great commotion, but I do not know what it was.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10018030-1">30&nbsp;</b>And the king said, “Turn aside and stand here.” So he turned aside and stood still.</p>

<p id="p10018030_22-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10018031-1">31&nbsp;</b>And behold, the Cushite came, and the Cushite said, “Good news for my lord the king! For the LORD has delivered you this day from the hand of all who rose up against you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10018032-1">32&nbsp;</b>The king said to the Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?” And the Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up against you for evil be like that young man.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10018033-1">33&nbsp;</b><sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f13-1" id="fb13-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;verse-numbering&quot;&gt;Ch 19:1 in Hebrew&lt;/note&gt;">13</a></sup> And the king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept. And as he went, he said, “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!”</p>

<p id="p43005009_09-1">Now that day was the Sabbath. <b class="verse-num" id="v43005010-1">10&nbsp;</b>So the Jews<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot;&gt;The Greek word &lt;i language=&quot;Greek&quot;&gt;Ioudaioi&lt;/i&gt; refers specifically here to Jewish religious leaders, and others under their influence, who opposed Jesus in that time; also verses 15, 16, 18&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.” <b class="verse-num" id="v43005011-1">11&nbsp;</b>But he answered them, “The man who healed me, that man said to me, <span class="woc">‘Take up your bed, and walk.’</span>” <b class="verse-num" id="v43005012-1">12&nbsp;</b>They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take up your bed and walk’?” <b class="verse-num" id="v43005013-1">13&nbsp;</b>Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place. <b class="verse-num" id="v43005014-1">14&nbsp;</b>Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, <span class="woc">“See, you are well!

<p id="p43005017_14-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43005018-1">18&nbsp;</b>This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</p>
