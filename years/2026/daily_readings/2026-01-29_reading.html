<p id="p01029001_06-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01029001-1">29&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob went on his journey and came to the land of the people of the east. <b class="verse-num" id="v01029002-1">2&nbsp;</b>As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep lying beside it, for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well’s mouth was large, <b class="verse-num" id="v01029003-1">3&nbsp;</b>and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well.</p>
<p id="p01029003_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01029004-1">4&nbsp;</b>Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where do you come from?” They said, “We are from Haran.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029005-1">5&nbsp;</b>He said to them, “Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029006-1">6&nbsp;</b>He said to them, “Is it well with him?” They said, “It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029007-1">7&nbsp;</b>He said, “Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep and go, pasture them.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029008-1">8&nbsp;</b>But they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.”</p>
<p id="p01029008_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01029009-1">9&nbsp;</b>While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. <b class="verse-num" id="v01029010-1">10&nbsp;</b>Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother. <b class="verse-num" id="v01029011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. <b class="verse-num" id="v01029012-1">12&nbsp;</b>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s kinsman, and that he was Rebekah’s son, and she ran and told her father.</p>
<p id="p01029012_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01029013-1">13&nbsp;</b>As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things, <b class="verse-num" id="v01029014-1">14&nbsp;</b>and Laban said to him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh!” And he stayed with him a month.</p>
<p id="p01029014_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01029015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029016-1">16&nbsp;</b>Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. <b class="verse-num" id="v01029017-1">17&nbsp;</b>Leah’s eyes were weak,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;soft&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. <b class="verse-num" id="v01029018-1">18&nbsp;</b>Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029019-1">19&nbsp;</b>Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029020-1">20&nbsp;</b>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.</p>
<p id="p01029020_06-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01029021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029022-1">22&nbsp;</b>So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a feast. <b class="verse-num" id="v01029023-1">23&nbsp;</b>But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and he went in to her. <b class="verse-num" id="v01029024-1">24&nbsp;</b>(Laban gave<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;had given&lt;/i&gt;; also verse 29&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> his female servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.) <b class="verse-num" id="v01029025-1">25&nbsp;</b>And in the morning, behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029026-1">26&nbsp;</b>Laban said, “It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. <b class="verse-num" id="v01029027-1">27&nbsp;</b>Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01029028-1">28&nbsp;</b>Jacob did so, and completed her week. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. <b class="verse-num" id="v01029029-1">29&nbsp;</b>(Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.) <b class="verse-num" id="v01029030-1">30&nbsp;</b>So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban for another seven years.</p>

He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban’s flock. <b class="verse-num" id="v01030041-1">41&nbsp;</b>Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks, <b class="verse-num" id="v01030042-1">42&nbsp;</b>but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there. So the feebler would be Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s. <b class="verse-num" id="v01030043-1">43&nbsp;</b>Thus the man increased greatly and had large flocks, female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.</p>

<h3 id="p40019001_01-1">Teaching About Divorce</h3>
<p id="p40019001_04-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v40019001-1">19&nbsp;</b>Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan. <b class="verse-num" id="v40019002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.</p>
<p id="p40019002_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40019003-1">3&nbsp;</b>And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful to divorce one’s wife for any cause?” <b class="verse-num" id="v40019004-1">4&nbsp;</b>He answered, <span class="woc">“Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female,</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40019005-1">5&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’?</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40019006-1">6&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40019007-1">7&nbsp;</b>They said to him, “Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?” <b class="verse-num" id="v40019008-1">8&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class="woc">“Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40019009-1">9&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot; sub-class=&quot;variant-adds&quot;&gt;Some manuscripts add &lt;i&gt;and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery&lt;/i&gt;; other manuscripts &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;except for sexual immorality&lt;/span&gt;, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p id="p40019009_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40019010-1">10&nbsp;</b>The disciples said to him, “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40019011-1">11&nbsp;</b>But he said to them, <span class="woc">“Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40019012-1">12&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.”</span></p>
<h3 id="p40019012_04-1">Let the Children Come to Me</h3>
<p id="p40019012_10-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40019013-1">13&nbsp;</b>Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people, <b class="verse-num" id="v40019014-1">14&nbsp;</b>but Jesus said, <span class="woc">“Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40019015-1">15&nbsp;</b>And he laid his hands on them and went away.</p>
<h3 id="p40019015_10-1">The Rich Young Man</h3>
<p id="p40019015_14-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40019016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And behold, a man came up to him, saying, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?” <b class="verse-num" id="v40019017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, <span class="woc">“Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40019018-1">18&nbsp;</b>He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, <span class="woc">“You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40019019-1">19&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40019020-1">20&nbsp;</b>The young man said to him, “All these I have kept. What do I still lack?” <b class="verse-num" id="v40019021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">“If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40019022-1">22&nbsp;</b>When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</p>
<p id="p40019022_14-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40019023-1">23&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to his disciples, <span class="woc">“Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40019024-1">24&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40019025-1">25&nbsp;</b>When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?” <b class="verse-num" id="v40019026-1">26&nbsp;</b>But Jesus looked at them and said, <span class="woc">“With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40019027-1">27&nbsp;</b>Then Peter said in reply, “See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?” <b class="verse-num" id="v40019028-1">28&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">“Truly, I say to you, in the new world,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Greek &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;in the&lt;/span&gt; regeneration&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40019029-1">29&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive a hundredfold<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot;&gt;Some manuscripts &lt;i&gt;manifold&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup> and will inherit eternal life.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40019030-1">30&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">But many who are first will be last, and the last first.</span></p>
