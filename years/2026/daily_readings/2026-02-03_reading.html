<p id="p01041001_05-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01041001-1">41&nbsp;</b>After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile, <b class="verse-num" id="v01041002-1">2&nbsp;</b>and behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows, attractive and plump, and they fed in the reed grass. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041003-1">3&nbsp;</b>And behold, seven other cows, ugly and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041004-1">4&nbsp;</b>And the ugly, thin cows ate up the seven attractive, plump cows. And Pharaoh awoke. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041005-1">5&nbsp;</b>And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time. And behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041007-1">7&nbsp;</b>And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump, full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041008-1">8&nbsp;</b>So in the morning his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was none who could interpret them to Pharaoh.</p>
<p id="p01041008_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01041009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “I remember my offenses today. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041010-1">10&nbsp;</b>When Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, <b class="verse-num" id="v01041011-1">11&nbsp;</b>we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own interpretation. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041012-1">12&nbsp;</b>A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. When we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041013-1">13&nbsp;</b>And as he interpreted to us, so it came about. I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged.”</p>
<p id="p01041013_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01041014-1">14&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they quickly brought him out of the pit. And when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041015-1">15&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01041016-1">16&nbsp;</b>Joseph answered Pharaoh, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or (compare Samaritan, Septuagint) &lt;i&gt;Without God it is not possible to give Pharaoh an answer about his welfare&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v01041017-1">17&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041018-1">18&nbsp;</b>Seven cows, plump and attractive, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041019-1">19&nbsp;</b>Seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041020-1">20&nbsp;</b>And the thin, ugly cows ate up the first seven plump cows, <b class="verse-num" id="v01041021-1">21&nbsp;</b>but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as ugly as at the beginning. Then I awoke. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041022-1">22&nbsp;</b>I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041023-1">23&nbsp;</b>Seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them, <b class="verse-num" id="v01041024-1">24&nbsp;</b>and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”</p>
<p id="p01041024_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01041025-1">25&nbsp;</b>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041026-1">26&nbsp;</b>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dreams are one. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041027-1">27&nbsp;</b>The seven lean and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041028-1">28&nbsp;</b>It is as I told Pharaoh; God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041029-1">29&nbsp;</b>There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt, <b class="verse-num" id="v01041030-1">30&nbsp;</b>but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land, <b class="verse-num" id="v01041031-1">31&nbsp;</b>and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of the famine that will follow, for it will be very severe. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041032-1">32&nbsp;</b>And the doubling of Pharaoh’s dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it about. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041033-1">33&nbsp;</b>Now therefore let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041034-1">34&nbsp;</b>Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land and take one-fifth of the produce of the land<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;over&lt;/span&gt; the land and organize the land&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> of Egypt during the seven plentiful years. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041035-1">35&nbsp;</b>And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041036-1">36&nbsp;</b>That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that are to occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine.”</p>
<h3 id="p01041036_05-1">Joseph Rises to Power</h3>
<p id="p01041036_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01041037-1">37&nbsp;</b>This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041038-1">38&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find a man like this, in whom is the Spirit of God?”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;of the gods&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v01041039-1">39&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discerning and wise as you are. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041040-1">40&nbsp;</b>You shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; according to your command all my people shall kiss the ground&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> Only as regards the throne will I be greater than you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01041041-1">41&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01041042-1">42&nbsp;</b>Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041043-1">43&nbsp;</b>And he made him ride in his second chariot. And they called out before him, “Bow the knee!”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;meaning-uncertain&quot;&gt;&lt;i language=&quot;Egyptian&quot;&gt;Abrek&lt;/i&gt;, probably an Egyptian word, similar in sound to the Hebrew word meaning &lt;i&gt;to kneel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">5</a></sup> Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041044-1">44&nbsp;</b>Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01041045-1">45&nbsp;</b>And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-paneah. And he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</p>
<p id="p01041045_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01041046-1">46&nbsp;</b>Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041047-1">47&nbsp;</b>During the seven plentiful years the earth produced abundantly, <b class="verse-num" id="v01041048-1">48&nbsp;</b>and he gathered up all the food of these seven years, which occurred in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities. He put in every city the food from the fields around it. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041049-1">49&nbsp;</b>And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.</p>
<p id="p01041049_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01041050-1">50&nbsp;</b>Before the year of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph. Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore them to him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041051-1">51&nbsp;</b>Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. “For,” he said, “God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father’s house.”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f6-1" id="fb6-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Manasseh&lt;/i&gt; sounds like the Hebrew for &lt;i&gt;making to forget&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">6</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v01041052-1">52&nbsp;</b>The name of the second he called Ephraim, “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f7-1" id="fb7-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Ephraim&lt;/i&gt; sounds like the Hebrew for &lt;i&gt;making fruitful&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">7</a></sup></p>
<p id="p01041052_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01041053-1">53&nbsp;</b>The seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt came to an end, <b class="verse-num" id="v01041054-1">54&nbsp;</b>and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041055-1">55&nbsp;</b>When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.”</p>
<p id="p01041055_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01041056-1">56&nbsp;</b>So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f8-1" id="fb8-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; that was in them&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">8</a></sup> and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. <b class="verse-num" id="v01041057-1">57&nbsp;</b>Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.</p>
<h3 id="p01042001_09-1">Joseph’s Brothers Go to Egypt</h3>
<p id="p01042001_14-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01042001-1">42&nbsp;</b>When Jacob learned that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01042002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And he said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain for sale in Egypt. Go down and buy grain for us there, that we may live and not die.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01042003-1">3&nbsp;</b>So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042004-1">4&nbsp;</b>But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might happen to him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p id="p01042005_14-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01042006-1">6&nbsp;</b>Now Joseph was governor over the land. He was the one who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042007-1">7&nbsp;</b>Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. “Where do you come from?” he said. They said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01042008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042009-1">9&nbsp;</b>And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them. And he said to them, “You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01042010-1">10&nbsp;</b>They said to him, “No, my lord, your servants have come to buy food. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042011-1">11&nbsp;</b>We are all sons of one man. We are honest men. Your servants have never been spies.”</p>
<p id="p01042011_14-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01042012-1">12&nbsp;</b>He said to them, “No, it is the nakedness of the land that you have come to see.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01042013-1">13&nbsp;</b>And they said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan, and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is no more.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01042014-1">14&nbsp;</b>But Joseph said to them, “It is as I said to you. You are spies. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042015-1">15&nbsp;</b>By this you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go from this place unless your youngest brother comes here. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042016-1">16&nbsp;</b>Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, while you remain confined, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. Or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01042017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And he put them all together in custody for three days.</p>
<p id="p01042017_14-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01042018-1">18&nbsp;</b>On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I fear God: <b class="verse-num" id="v01042019-1">19&nbsp;</b>if you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain confined where you are in custody, and let the rest go and carry grain for the famine of your households, <b class="verse-num" id="v01042020-1">20&nbsp;</b>and bring your youngest brother to me. So your words will be verified, and you shall not die.” And they did so. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Then they said to one another, “In truth we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us and we did not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01042022-1">22&nbsp;</b>And Reuben answered them, “Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy? But you did not listen. So now there comes a reckoning for his blood.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01042023-1">23&nbsp;</b>They did not know that Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042024-1">24&nbsp;</b>Then he turned away from them and wept. And he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042025-1">25&nbsp;</b>And Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, and to replace every man’s money in his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. This was done for them.</p>
<p id="p01042025_14-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01042026-1">26&nbsp;</b>Then they loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042027-1">27&nbsp;</b>And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, he saw his money in the mouth of his sack. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042028-1">28&nbsp;</b>He said to his brothers, “My money has been put back; here it is in the mouth of my sack!” At this their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”</p>
<p id="p01042028_14-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01042029-1">29&nbsp;</b>When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying, <b class="verse-num" id="v01042030-1">30&nbsp;</b>“The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us to be spies of the land. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042031-1">31&nbsp;</b>But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we have never been spies. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042032-1">32&nbsp;</b>We are twelve brothers, sons of our father. One is no more, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v01042033-1">33&nbsp;</b>Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I shall know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go your way. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042034-1">34&nbsp;</b>Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I shall know that you are not spies but honest men, and I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.’”</p>
<p id="p01042034_14-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01042035-1">35&nbsp;</b>As they emptied their sacks, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. <b class="verse-num" id="v01042036-1">36&nbsp;</b>And Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and now you would take Benjamin. All this has come against me.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01042037-1">37&nbsp;</b>Then Reuben said to his father, “Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01042038-1">38&nbsp;</b>But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is the only one left. If harm should happen to him on the journey that you are to make, you would bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”</p>

<p id="p40022001_07-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v40022001-1">22&nbsp;</b>And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40022002-1">2&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">“The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son,</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40022003-1">3&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">and sent his servants<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;bondservant&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;bondservants&lt;/i&gt;; also verses 4, 6, 8, 10&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40022004-1">4&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40022005-1">5&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business,</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40022006-1">6&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40022007-1">7&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40022008-1">8&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40022009-1">9&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.’</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40022010-1">10&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good.
