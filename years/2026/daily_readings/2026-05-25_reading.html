<h3 id="p43009001_01-1">Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind</h3>
<p class="starts-chapter" id="p43009001_07-1"><b class="chapter-num" id="v43009001-1">9 </b>As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. <b class="verse-num" id="v43009002-1">2 </b>And his disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” <b class="verse-num" id="v43009003-1">3 </b>Jesus answered, <span class="woc">“It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43009004-1">4 </b><span class="woc">We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43009005-1">5 </b><span class="woc">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v43009006-1">6 </b>Having said these things, he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he anointed the man’s eyes with the mud <b class="verse-num" id="v43009007-1">7 </b>and said to him, <span class="woc">“Go, wash in the pool of Siloam”</span> (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing.</p>
<p id="p43009007_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43009008-1">8 </b>The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, “Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?” <b class="verse-num" id="v43009009-1">9 </b>Some said, “It is he.” Others said, “No, but he is like him.” He kept saying, “I am the man.” <b class="verse-num" id="v43009010-1">10 </b>So they said to him, “Then how were your eyes opened?” <b class="verse-num" id="v43009011-1">11 </b>He answered, “The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, <span class="woc">‘Go to Siloam and wash.’</span> So I went and washed and received my sight.” <b class="verse-num" id="v43009012-1">12 </b>They said to him, “Where is he?” He said, “I do not know.”</p>
<p id="p43009012_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43009013-1">13 </b>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. <b class="verse-num" id="v43009014-1">14 </b>Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. <b class="verse-num" id="v43009015-1">15 </b>So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.” <b class="verse-num" id="v43009016-1">16 </b>Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.” But others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” And there was a division among them. <b class="verse-num" id="v43009017-1">17 </b>So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?” He said, “He is a prophet.”</p>

How then does he now see?” <b class="verse-num" id="v43009020-1">20 </b>His parents answered, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. <b class="verse-num" id="v43009021-1">21 </b>But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.” <b class="verse-num" id="v43009022-1">22 </b>(His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title='&lt;note class="translation" sub-class="original"&gt;Greek &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>2</a></sup> to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue. <b class="verse-num" id="v43009023-1">23 </b>Therefore his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”)</p>
