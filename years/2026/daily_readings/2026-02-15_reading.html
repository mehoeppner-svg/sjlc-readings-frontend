<p id="p40027051_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40027051-1">51&nbsp;</b>And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027052-1">52&nbsp;</b>The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, <b class="verse-num" id="v40027053-1">53&nbsp;</b>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027054-1">54&nbsp;</b>When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, “Truly this was the Son<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;a son&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> of God!”</p>
<p id="p40027054_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40027055-1">55&nbsp;</b>There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, <b class="verse-num" id="v40027056-1">56&nbsp;</b>among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</p>
<h3 id="p40027056_01-1">Jesus Is Buried</h3>
<p id="p40027056_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40027057-1">57&nbsp;</b>When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027058-1">58&nbsp;</b>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027059-1">59&nbsp;</b>And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud <b class="verse-num" id="v40027060-1">60&nbsp;</b>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. <b class="verse-num" id="v40027061-1">61&nbsp;</b>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</p>
<h3 id="p40027061_04-1">The Guard at the Tomb</h3>
<p id="p40027061_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40027062-1">62&nbsp;</b>The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate <b class="verse-num" id="v40027063-1">63&nbsp;</b>and said, “Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v40027064-1">64&nbsp;</b>Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last fraud will be worse than the first.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40027065-1">65&nbsp;</b>Pilate said to them, “You have a guard<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;Take a guard&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40027066-1">66&nbsp;</b>So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.</p>
