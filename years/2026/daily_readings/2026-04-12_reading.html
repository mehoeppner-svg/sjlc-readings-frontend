Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42011041-1">41 </b><span class="woc">But give as alms those things that are within, and behold, everything is clean for you.</span></p>
<p id="p42011041_15-1"><b class="verse-num woc" id="v42011042-1">42 </b><span class="woc">“But woe to you Pharisees!
