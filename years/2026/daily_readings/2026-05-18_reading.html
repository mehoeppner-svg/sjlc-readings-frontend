So also the fish, as much as they wanted. <b class="verse-num" id="v43006012-1">12 </b>And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, <span class="woc">“Gather up the leftover fragments, that nothing may be lost.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v43006013-1">13 </b>So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten. <b class="verse-num" id="v43006014-1">14 </b>When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, “This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world!”</p>
