<p id="p42010025_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v42010025-1">25 </b>And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” <b class="verse-num" id="v42010026-1">26 </b>He said to him, <span class="woc">“What is written in the Law? How do you read it?”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v42010027-1">27 </b>And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” <b class="verse-num" id="v42010028-1">28 </b>And he said to him, <span class="woc">“You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.”</span></p>
<p id="p42010028_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v42010029-1">29 </b>But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” <b class="verse-num" id="v42010030-1">30 </b>Jesus replied, <span class="woc">“A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42010031-1">31 </b><span class="woc">Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42010032-1">32 </b><span class="woc">So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42010033-1">33 </b><span class="woc">But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42010034-1">34 </b><span class="woc">He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42010035-1">35 </b><span class="woc">And the next day he took out two denarii<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title='&lt;note class="background" sub-class="measurement"&gt;A &lt;i class="catch-word-plural"&gt;denarius&lt;/i&gt; was a day’s wage for a laborer&lt;/note&gt;'>1</a></sup> and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.’</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42010036-1">36 </b><span class="woc">Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v42010037-1">37 </b>He said, “The one who showed him mercy.” And Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">“You go, and do likewise.”</span></p>

<p id="p42010037_10-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v42010038-1">38 </b>Now as they went on their way, Jesus<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title='&lt;note class="translation" sub-class="original"&gt;Greek &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>2</a></sup> entered a village. And a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house. <b class="verse-num" id="v42010039-1">39 </b>And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to his teaching. <b class="verse-num" id="v42010040-1">40 </b>But Martha was distracted with much serving. And she went up to him and said, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.” <b class="verse-num" id="v42010041-1">41 </b>But the Lord answered her, <span class="woc">“Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v42010042-1">42 </b><span class="woc">but one thing is necessary.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title='&lt;note class="variant"&gt;Some manuscripts &lt;i&gt;few things are necessary, or only one&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>3</a></sup> Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.”</span></p>
