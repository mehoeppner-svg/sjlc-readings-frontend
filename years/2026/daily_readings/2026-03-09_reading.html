<p id="p41011019_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v41011020-1">20&nbsp;</b>As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. <b class="verse-num" id="v41011021-1">21&nbsp;</b>And Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.” <b class="verse-num" id="v41011022-1">22&nbsp;</b>And Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">“Have faith in God.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v41011023-1">23&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v41011024-1">24&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot;&gt;Some manuscripts &lt;i&gt;are receiving&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> it, and it will be yours.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v41011025-1">25&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot; sub-class=&quot;variant-adds&quot;&gt;Some manuscripts add verse 26: &lt;i&gt;But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup></span></p>

<p id="p41011025_13-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v41011027-1">27&nbsp;</b>And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him, <b class="verse-num" id="v41011028-1">28&nbsp;</b>and they said to him, “By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?” <b class="verse-num" id="v41011029-1">29&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">“I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v41011030-1">30&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man? Answer me.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v41011031-1">31&nbsp;</b>And they discussed it with one another, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ <b class="verse-num" id="v41011032-1">32&nbsp;</b>But shall we say, ‘From man’?”—they were afraid of the people, for they all held that John really was a prophet. <b class="verse-num" id="v41011033-1">33&nbsp;</b>So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”</span></p>
