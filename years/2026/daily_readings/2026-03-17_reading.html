<p id="p04017007_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v04017008-1">8 </b>On the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony, and behold, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms, and it bore ripe almonds. <b class="verse-num" id="v04017009-1">9 </b>Then Moses brought out all the staffs from before the LORD to all the people of Israel.
