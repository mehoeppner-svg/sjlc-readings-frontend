<p id="p05020018_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v05020019-1">19 </b>“When you besiege a city for a long time, making war against it in order to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an axe against them. You may eat from them, but you shall not cut them down. Are the trees in the field human, that they should be besieged by you? <b class="verse-num" id="v05020020-1">20 </b>Only the trees that you know are not trees for food you may destroy and cut down, that you may build siegeworks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.</p>

<h3 id="p05021017_16-1">A Rebellious Son</h3>
<p id="p05021017_19-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v05021018-1">18 </b>“If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and, though they discipline him, will not listen to them, <b class="verse-num" id="v05021019-1">19 </b>then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gate of the place where he lives, <b class="verse-num" id="v05021020-1">20 </b>and they shall say to the elders of his city, ‘This our son is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v05021021-1">21 </b>Then all the men of the city shall stone him to death with stones.
