Do not fear or panic or be in dread of them, <b class="verse-num" id="v05020004-1">4&nbsp;</b>for the LORD your God is he who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to give you the victory.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v05020005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Then the officers shall speak to the people, saying, ‘Is there any man who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it. <b class="verse-num" id="v05020006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And is there any man who has planted a vineyard and has not enjoyed its fruit? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man enjoy its fruit. <b class="verse-num" id="v05020007-1">7&nbsp;</b>And is there any man who has betrothed a wife and has not taken her? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man take her.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v05020008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And the officers shall speak further to the people, and say, ‘Is there any man who is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go back to his house, lest he make the heart of his fellows melt like his own.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v05020009-1">9&nbsp;</b>And when the officers have finished speaking to the people, then commanders shall be appointed at the head of the people.</p>
