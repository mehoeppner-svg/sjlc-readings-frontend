<p class="starts-chapter" id="p10021001_05-1"><b class="chapter-num" id="v10021001-1">21 </b>Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year. And David sought the face of the LORD. And the LORD said, “There is bloodguilt on Saul and on his house, because he put the Gibeonites to death.” <b class="verse-num" id="v10021002-1">2 </b>So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites were not of the people of Israel but of the remnant of the Amorites. Although the people of Israel had sworn to spare them, Saul had sought to strike them down in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah. <b class="verse-num" id="v10021003-1">3 </b>And David said to the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? And how shall I make atonement, that you may bless the heritage of the LORD?” <b class="verse-num" id="v10021004-1">4 </b>The Gibeonites said to him, “It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.” And he said, “What do you say that I shall do for you?” <b class="verse-num" id="v10021005-1">5 </b>They said to the king, “The man who consumed us and planned to destroy us, so that we should have no place in all the territory of Israel, <b class="verse-num" id="v10021006-1">6 </b>let seven of his sons be given to us, so that we may hang them before the LORD at Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD.” And the king said, “I will give them.”</p>
<p id="p10021006_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10021007-1">7 </b>But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Saul’s son Jonathan, because of the oath of the LORD that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul. <b class="verse-num" id="v10021008-1">8 </b>The king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Merab<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title='&lt;note class="variant"&gt;Two Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint; most Hebrew manuscripts &lt;i&gt;Michal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;'>1</a></sup> the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite; <b class="verse-num" id="v10021009-1">9 </b>and he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the mountain before the LORD, and the seven of them perished together. They were put to death in the first days of harvest, at the beginning of barley harvest.</p>
<p id="p10021009_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10021010-1">10 </b>Then Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until rain fell upon them from the heavens. And she did not allow the birds of the air to come upon them by day, or the beasts of the field by night. <b class="verse-num" id="v10021011-1">11 </b>When David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done, <b class="verse-num" id="v10021012-1">12 </b>David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, on the day the Philistines killed Saul on Gilboa. <b class="verse-num" id="v10021013-1">13 </b>And he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan; and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged. <b class="verse-num" id="v10021014-1">14 </b>And they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father. And they did all that the king commanded. And after that God responded to the plea for the land.</p>

<p id="p10021014_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10021015-1">15 </b>There was war again between the Philistines and Israel, and David went down together with his servants, and they fought against the Philistines. And David grew weary. <b class="verse-num" id="v10021016-1">16 </b>And Ishbi-benob, one of the descendants of the giants, whose spear weighed three hundred shekels<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title='&lt;note class="background" sub-class="measurement"&gt;A &lt;i class="catch-word-plural"&gt;shekel&lt;/i&gt; was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams&lt;/note&gt;'>2</a></sup> of bronze, and who was armed with a new sword, thought to kill David. <b class="verse-num" id="v10021017-1">17 </b>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid and attacked the Philistine and killed him. Then David’s men swore to him, “You shall no longer go out with us to battle, lest you quench the lamp of Israel.”</p>
<p id="p10021017_09-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v10021018-1">18 </b>After this there was again war with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Saph, who was one of the descendants of the giants. <b class="verse-num" id="v10021019-1">19 </b>And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, the Bethlehemite, struck down Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title='&lt;note class="translation" sub-class="compare-verse"&gt;Contrast 1 Chronicles 20:5, which may preserve the original reading&lt;/note&gt;'>3</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v10021020-1">20 </b>And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number, and he also was descended from the giants. <b class="verse-num" id="v10021021-1">21 </b>And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, struck him down. <b class="verse-num" id="v10021022-1">22 </b>These four were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.</p>

<h3 id="p43006022_01-1">I Am the Bread of Life</h3>
<p id="p43006022_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43006022-1">22 </b>On the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone. <b class="verse-num" id="v43006023-1">23 </b>Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. <b class="verse-num" id="v43006024-1">24 </b>So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</p>
<p id="p43006024_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43006025-1">25 </b>When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?” <b class="verse-num" id="v43006026-1">26 </b>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">“Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43006027-1">27 </b><span class="woc">Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on him God the Father has set his seal.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v43006028-1">28 </b>Then they said to him, “What must we do, to be doing the works of God?” <b class="verse-num" id="v43006029-1">29 </b>Jesus answered them, <span class="woc">“This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v43006030-1">30 </b>So they said to him, “Then what sign do you do, that we may see and believe you? What work do you perform? <b class="verse-num" id="v43006031-1">31 </b>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v43006032-1">32 </b>Jesus then said to them, <span class="woc">“Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43006033-1">33 </b><span class="woc">For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v43006034-1">34 </b>They said to him, “Sir, give us this bread always.”</p>
<p id="p43006034_07-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v43006035-1">35 </b>Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">“I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43006036-1">36 </b><span class="woc">But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43006037-1">37 </b><span class="woc">All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43006038-1">38 </b><span class="woc">For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43006039-1">39 </b><span class="woc">And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v43006040-1">40 </b><span class="woc">For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”</span></p>
