<h3 id="p41002001_01-1">Jesus Heals a Paralytic</h3>
<p id="p41002001_05-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v41002001-1">2&nbsp;</b>And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home. <b class="verse-num" id="v41002002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them. <b class="verse-num" id="v41002003-1">3&nbsp;</b>And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. <b class="verse-num" id="v41002004-1">4&nbsp;</b>And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay. <b class="verse-num" id="v41002005-1">5&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, <span class="woc">“Son, your sins are forgiven.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v41002006-1">6&nbsp;</b>Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, <b class="verse-num" id="v41002007-1">7&nbsp;</b>“Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” <b class="verse-num" id="v41002008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, <span class="woc">“Why do you question these things in your hearts?</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v41002009-1">9&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, take up your bed and walk’?</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v41002010-1">10&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</span>—he said to the paralytic—<b class="verse-num woc" id="v41002011-1">11&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">“I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v41002012-1">12&nbsp;</b>And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”</p>
<h3 id="p41002012_05-1">Jesus Calls Levi</h3>
<p id="p41002012_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v41002013-1">13&nbsp;</b>He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them. <b class="verse-num" id="v41002014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, <span class="woc">“Follow me.”</span> And he rose and followed him.</p>
<p id="p41002014_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v41002015-1">15&nbsp;</b>And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. <b class="verse-num" id="v41002016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And the scribes of<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot;&gt;Some manuscripts &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, “Why does he eat<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot; sub-class=&quot;variant-adds&quot;&gt;Some manuscripts add &lt;i&gt;and drink&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> with tax collectors and sinners?” <b class="verse-num" id="v41002017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, <span class="woc">“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.”</span></p>
<h3 id="p41002017_08-1">A Question About Fasting</h3>
<p id="p41002017_12-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v41002018-1">18&nbsp;</b>Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?” <b class="verse-num" id="v41002019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And Jesus said to them, <span class="woc">“Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v41002020-1">20&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v41002021-1">21&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v41002022-1">22&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins—and the wine is destroyed, and so are the skins.
