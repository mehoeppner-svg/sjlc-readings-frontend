And the people of Israel cried out to the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v02014011-1">11&nbsp;</b>They said to Moses, “Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us in bringing us out of Egypt? <b class="verse-num" id="v02014012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Is not this what we said to you in Egypt: ‘Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02014013-1">13&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to the people, “Fear not, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will work for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again. <b class="verse-num" id="v02014014-1">14&nbsp;</b>The LORD will fight for you, and you have only to be silent.”</p>
<p id="p02014014_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02014015-1">15&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Moses, “Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of Israel to go forward. <b class="verse-num" id="v02014016-1">16&nbsp;</b>Lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, that the people of Israel may go through the sea on dry ground. <b class="verse-num" id="v02014017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen. <b class="verse-num" id="v02014018-1">18&nbsp;</b>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”</p>

<p id="p02014025_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02014026-1">26&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02014027-1">27&nbsp;</b>So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal course when the morning appeared.

<p id="p02014029_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02014030-1">30&nbsp;</b>Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. <b class="verse-num" id="v02014031-1">31&nbsp;</b>Israel saw the great power that the LORD used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in his servant Moses.</p>

<p id="p40026036_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40026036-1">36&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, <span class="woc">“Sit here, while I go over there and pray.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40026037-1">37&nbsp;</b>And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. <b class="verse-num" id="v40026038-1">38&nbsp;</b>Then he said to them, <span class="woc">“My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;keep awake&lt;/i&gt;; also verses 40, 41&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> with me.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40026039-1">39&nbsp;</b>And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, <span class="woc">“My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40026040-1">40&nbsp;</b>And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, <span class="woc">“So, could you not watch with me one hour?</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40026041-1">41&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40026042-1">42&nbsp;</b>Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, <span class="woc">“My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40026043-1">43&nbsp;</b>And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <b class="verse-num" id="v40026044-1">44&nbsp;</b>So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again. <b class="verse-num" id="v40026045-1">45&nbsp;</b>Then he came to the disciples and said to them, <span class="woc">“Sleep and take your rest later on.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;Are you still sleeping and taking your rest?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40026046-1">46&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.”</span></p>
<h3 id="p40026046_05-1">Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus</h3>
<p id="p40026046_10-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40026047-1">47&nbsp;</b>While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. <b class="verse-num" id="v40026048-1">48&nbsp;</b>Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I will kiss is the man; seize him.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40026049-1">49&nbsp;</b>And he came up to Jesus at once and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” And he kissed him. <b class="verse-num" id="v40026050-1">50&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">“Friend, do what you came to do.”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Friend&lt;/span&gt;, why are you here?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup></span> Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. <b class="verse-num" id="v40026051-1">51&nbsp;</b>And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;bondservant&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;bondservant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> of the high priest and cut off his ear. <b class="verse-num" id="v40026052-1">52&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">“Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40026053-1">53&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40026054-1">54&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40026055-1">55&nbsp;</b>At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, <span class="woc">“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.</span> <b class="verse-num woc" id="v40026056-1">56&nbsp;</b><span class="woc">But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”</span> Then all the disciples left him and fled.</p>
<h3 id="p40026056_10-1">Jesus Before Caiaphas and the Council</h3>
<p id="p40026056_16-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40026057-1">57&nbsp;</b>Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. <b class="verse-num" id="v40026058-1">58&nbsp;</b>And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. <b class="verse-num" id="v40026059-1">59&nbsp;</b>Now the chief priests and the whole council<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Greek &lt;i&gt;Sanhedrin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">5</a></sup> were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, <b class="verse-num" id="v40026060-1">60&nbsp;</b>but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward <b class="verse-num" id="v40026061-1">61&nbsp;</b>and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v40026062-1">62&nbsp;</b>And the high priest stood up and said, “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f6-1" id="fb6-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;Have you no answer to what these men testify against you?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">6</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v40026063-1">63&nbsp;</b>But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, “I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40026064-1">64&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class="woc">“You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</span> <b class="verse-num" id="v40026065-1">65&nbsp;</b>Then the high priest tore his robes and said, “He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. <b class="verse-num" id="v40026066-1">66&nbsp;</b>What is your judgment?” They answered, “He deserves death.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40026067-1">67&nbsp;</b>Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him, <b class="verse-num" id="v40026068-1">68&nbsp;</b>saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?”</p>
<h3 id="p40026068_16-1">Peter Denies Jesus</h3>
<p id="p40026068_19-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v40026069-1">69&nbsp;</b>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40026070-1">70&nbsp;</b>But he denied it before them all, saying, “I do not know what you mean.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40026071-1">71&nbsp;</b>And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40026072-1">72&nbsp;</b>And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40026073-1">73&nbsp;</b>After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v40026074-1">74&nbsp;</b>Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know the man.” And immediately the rooster crowed. <b class="verse-num" id="v40026075-1">75&nbsp;</b>And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, <span class="woc">“Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span> And he went out and wept bitterly.</p>
