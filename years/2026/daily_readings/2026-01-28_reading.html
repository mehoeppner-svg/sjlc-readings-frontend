<p id="p01027001_04-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01027001-1">27&nbsp;</b>When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son and said to him, “My son”; and he answered, “Here I am.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027002-1">2&nbsp;</b>He said, “Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me, <b class="verse-num" id="v01027004-1">4&nbsp;</b>and prepare for me delicious food, such as I love, and bring it to me so that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die.”</p>
<p id="p01027004_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it, <b class="verse-num" id="v01027006-1">6&nbsp;</b>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, <b class="verse-num" id="v01027007-1">7&nbsp;</b>‘Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD before I die.’ <b class="verse-num" id="v01027008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027010-1">10&nbsp;</b>And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027011-1">11&nbsp;</b>But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027013-1">13&nbsp;</b>His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.”</p>
<p id="p01027013_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027014-1">14&nbsp;</b>So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</p>
<p id="p01027017_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027018-1">18&nbsp;</b>So he went in to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027019-1">19&nbsp;</b>Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027020-1">20&nbsp;</b>But Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” He answered, “Because the LORD your God granted me success.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027022-1">22&nbsp;</b>So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027023-1">23&nbsp;</b>And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands. So he blessed him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01027024-1">24&nbsp;</b>He said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He answered, “I am.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027025-1">25&nbsp;</b>Then he said, “Bring it near to me, that I may eat of my son’s game and bless you.” So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.</p>
<p id="p01027025_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027026-1">26&nbsp;</b>Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near and kiss me, my son.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027027-1">27&nbsp;</b>So he came near and kissed him. And Isaac smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him and said,</p>

And he said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son’s game, that you may bless me.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027032-1">32&nbsp;</b>His father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027033-1">33&nbsp;</b>Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, “Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027034-1">34&nbsp;</b>As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, O my father!” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027035-1">35&nbsp;</b>But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01027036-1">36&nbsp;</b>Esau said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob?<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Jacob&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;He takes by the heel&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;He cheats&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> For he has cheated me these two times.

<p id="p01027045_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01027046-1">46&nbsp;</b>Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I loathe my life because of the Hittite women.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;daughters of Heth&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?”</p>

<p id="p01028001_08-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01028001-1">28&nbsp;</b>Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and directed him, “You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women. <b class="verse-num" id="v01028002-1">2&nbsp;</b>Arise, go to Paddan-aram to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father, and take as your wife from there one of the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother. <b class="verse-num" id="v01028003-1">3&nbsp;</b>God Almighty<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i language=&quot;Hebrew&quot;&gt;El Shaddai&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">5</a></sup> bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples. <b class="verse-num" id="v01028004-1">4&nbsp;</b>May he give the blessing of Abraham to you and to your offspring with you, that you may take possession of the land of your sojournings that God gave to Abraham!” <b class="verse-num" id="v01028005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Thus Isaac sent Jacob away.

For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01028016-1">16&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01028017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place!

<p id="p01028017_14-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01028018-1">18&nbsp;</b>So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. <b class="verse-num" id="v01028019-1">19&nbsp;</b>He called the name of that place Bethel,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f8-1" id="fb8-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Bethel&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;the house of God&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">8</a></sup> but the name of the city was Luz at the first. <b class="verse-num" id="v01028020-1">20&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, <b class="verse-num" id="v01028021-1">21&nbsp;</b>so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God, <b class="verse-num" id="v01028022-1">22&nbsp;</b>and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God’s house.
