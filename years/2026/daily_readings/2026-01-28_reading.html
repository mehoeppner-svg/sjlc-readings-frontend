Say to them, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.’”</p>
<p id="p02016012_01-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v02016013-1">13&nbsp;</b>In the evening quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning dew lay around the camp. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as frost on the ground. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016015-1">15&nbsp;</b>When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;“It is manna”&lt;/i&gt;; Hebrew &lt;i&gt;man hu&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, “It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016016-1">16&nbsp;</b>This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Gather of it, each one of you, as much as he can eat. You shall each take an omer,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;background&quot; sub-class=&quot;measurement&quot;&gt;An &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;omer&lt;/i&gt; was about 2 quarts or 2 liters&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> according to the number of the persons that each of you has in his tent.’” <b class="verse-num" id="v02016017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016018-1">18&nbsp;</b>But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat. <b class="verse-num" id="v02016019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And Moses said to them, “Let no one leave any of it over till the morning.” <b class="verse-num" id="v02016020-1">20&nbsp;</b>But they did not listen to Moses. Some left part of it till the morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them.</p>
