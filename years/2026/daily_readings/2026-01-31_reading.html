<p id="p01033001_04-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01033001-1">33&nbsp;</b>And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two female servants. <b class="verse-num" id="v01033002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And he put the servants with their children in front, then Leah with her children, and Rachel and Joseph last of all. <b class="verse-num" id="v01033003-1">3&nbsp;</b>He himself went on before them, bowing himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</p>
<p id="p01033003_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01033004-1">4&nbsp;</b>But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept. <b class="verse-num" id="v01033005-1">5&nbsp;</b>And when Esau lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children, he said, “Who are these with you?” Jacob said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01033006-1">6&nbsp;</b>Then the servants drew near, they and their children, and bowed down. <b class="verse-num" id="v01033007-1">7&nbsp;</b>Leah likewise and her children drew near and bowed down. And last Joseph and Rachel drew near, and they bowed down. <b class="verse-num" id="v01033008-1">8&nbsp;</b>Esau said, “What do you mean by all this company<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;original&quot;&gt;Hebrew &lt;i&gt;camp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> that I met?” Jacob answered, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01033009-1">9&nbsp;</b>But Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01033010-1">10&nbsp;</b>Jacob said, “No, please, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand. For I have seen your face, which is like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me. <b class="verse-num" id="v01033011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Please accept my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” Thus he urged him, and he took it.</p>
<p id="p01033011_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01033012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Then Esau said, “Let us journey on our way, and I will go ahead of<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;along with&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup> you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01033013-1">13&nbsp;</b>But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and that the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me. If they are driven hard for one day, all the flocks will die. <b class="verse-num" id="v01033014-1">14&nbsp;</b>Let my lord pass on ahead of his servant, and I will lead on slowly, at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”</p>
<p id="p01033014_04-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01033015-1">15&nbsp;</b>So Esau said, “Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01033016-1">16&nbsp;</b>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. <b class="verse-num" id="v01033017-1">17&nbsp;</b>But Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Succoth&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;booths&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="p01034001_04-1">The Defiling of Dinah</h3>
<p id="p01034001_08-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01034001-1">34&nbsp;</b>Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the women of the land. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034002-1">2&nbsp;</b>And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humiliated her. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034003-1">3&nbsp;</b>And his soul was drawn to Dinah the daughter of Jacob. He loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034004-1">4&nbsp;</b>So Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, “Get me this girl for my wife.”</p>
<p id="p01034004_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01034005-1">5&nbsp;</b>Now Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah. But his sons were with his livestock in the field, so Jacob held his peace until they came. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034007-1">7&nbsp;</b>The sons of Jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it, and the men were indignant and very angry, because he had done an outrageous thing in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, for such a thing must not be done.</p>
<p id="p01034007_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01034008-1">8&nbsp;</b>But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longs for your<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f7-1" id="fb7-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;plurality&quot;&gt;The Hebrew for &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; is plural here&lt;/note&gt;">7</a></sup> daughter. Please give her to him to be his wife. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Make marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034010-1">10&nbsp;</b>You shall dwell with us, and the land shall be open to you. Dwell and trade in it, and get property in it.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01034011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Shechem also said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Ask me for as great a bride-price<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f8-1" id="fb8-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;engagement present&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">8</a></sup> and gift as you will, and I will give whatever you say to me. Only give me the young woman to be my wife.”</p>
<p id="p01034012_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01034013-1">13&nbsp;</b>The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034014-1">14&nbsp;</b>They said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Only on this condition will we agree with you—that you will become as we are by every male among you being circumcised. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034016-1">16&nbsp;</b>Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to ourselves, and we will dwell with you and become one people. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034017-1">17&nbsp;</b>But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone.”</p>
<p id="p01034017_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01034018-1">18&nbsp;</b>Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor’s son Shechem. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob’s daughter. Now he was the most honored of all his father’s house. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034020-1">20&nbsp;</b>So Hamor and his son Shechem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying, <b class="verse-num" id="v01034021-1">21&nbsp;</b>“These men are at peace with us; let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters as wives, and let us give them our daughters. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034022-1">22&nbsp;</b>Only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us to become one people—when every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034023-1">23&nbsp;</b>Will not their livestock, their property and all their beasts be ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will dwell with us.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01034024-1">24&nbsp;</b>And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.</p>
<p id="p01034024_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01034025-1">25&nbsp;</b>On the third day, when they were sore, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and came against the city while it felt secure and killed all the males. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034026-1">26&nbsp;</b>They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house and went away. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034027-1">27&nbsp;</b>The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034028-1">28&nbsp;</b>They took their flocks and their herds, their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field. <b class="verse-num" id="v01034029-1">29&nbsp;</b>All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and plundered.</p>
<p id="p01034029_08-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01034030-1">30&nbsp;</b>Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites. My numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01034031-1">31&nbsp;</b>But they said, “Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?”</p>
<h3 id="p01035001_08-1">God Blesses and Renames Jacob</h3>
<p id="p01035001_13-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v01035001-1">35&nbsp;</b>God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01035002-1">2&nbsp;</b>So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments. <b class="verse-num" id="v01035003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Then let us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.” <b class="verse-num" id="v01035004-1">4&nbsp;</b>So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears.

<p id="p01035004_13-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v01035005-1">5&nbsp;</b>And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. <b class="verse-num" id="v01035006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him, <b class="verse-num" id="v01035007-1">7&nbsp;</b>and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f9-1" id="fb9-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;El-bethel&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;God of Bethel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">9</a></sup> because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother. <b class="verse-num" id="v01035008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel.
