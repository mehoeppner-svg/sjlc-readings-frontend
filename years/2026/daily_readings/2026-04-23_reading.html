<h3 id="p09001001_01-1">The Birth of Samuel</h3>
<p id="p09001001_05-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v09001001-1">1&nbsp;</b>There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001002-1">2&nbsp;</b>He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p>
<p id="p09001002_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09001003-1">3&nbsp;</b>Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001004-1">4&nbsp;</b>On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001005-1">5&nbsp;</b>But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the LORD had closed her womb.<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f1-1" id="fb1-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;translation&quot; sub-class=&quot;meaning-uncertain&quot;&gt;Syriac; the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. Septuagint &lt;i&gt;And, although he loved Hannah, he would give Hannah only one portion, because the &lt;span class=&quot;divine-name&quot;&gt;Lord&lt;/span&gt; had closed her womb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">1</a></sup> <b class="verse-num" id="v09001006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001007-1">7&nbsp;</b>So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?”</p>
<p id="p09001008_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09001009-1">9&nbsp;</b>After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001010-1">10&nbsp;</b>She was deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001011-1">11&nbsp;</b>And she vowed a vow and said, “O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.”</p>
<p id="p09001011_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09001012-1">12&nbsp;</b>As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001013-1">13&nbsp;</b>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001014-1">14&nbsp;</b>And Eli said to her, “How long will you go on being drunk? Put your wine away from you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09001015-1">15&nbsp;</b>But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001016-1">16&nbsp;</b>Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09001017-1">17&nbsp;</b>Then Eli answered, “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09001018-1">18&nbsp;</b>And she said, “Let your servant find favor in your eyes.” Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.</p>
<p id="p09001018_05-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09001019-1">19&nbsp;</b>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001020-1">20&nbsp;</b>And in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, “I have asked for him from the LORD.”<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f2-1" id="fb2-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;explanation&quot; sub-class=&quot;name-meaning&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;Samuel&lt;/i&gt; sounds like the Hebrew for &lt;i&gt;heard of God&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">2</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="p09001020_05-1">Samuel Given to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span></h3>
<p id="p09001020_10-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09001021-1">21&nbsp;</b>The man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001022-1">22&nbsp;</b>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear in the presence of the LORD and dwell there forever.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09001023-1">23&nbsp;</b>Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him; only, may the LORD establish his word.” So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001024-1">24&nbsp;</b>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f3-1" id="fb3-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;variant&quot;&gt;Dead Sea Scroll, Septuagint, Syriac; Masoretic Text &lt;i&gt;three bulls&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">3</a></sup> an ephah<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f4-1" id="fb4-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;background&quot; sub-class=&quot;measurement&quot;&gt;An &lt;i class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;ephah&lt;/i&gt; was about 3/5 bushel or 22 liters&lt;/note&gt;">4</a></sup> of flour, and a skin of wine, and she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. And the child was young. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001025-1">25&nbsp;</b>Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001026-1">26&nbsp;</b>And she said, “Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001027-1">27&nbsp;</b>For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my petition that I made to him. <b class="verse-num" id="v09001028-1">28&nbsp;</b>Therefore I have lent him to the LORD. As long as he lives, he is lent to the LORD.”</p>

<h3 id="p09002011_12-1">Eli’s Worthless Sons</h3>
<p id="p09002011_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09002012-1">12&nbsp;</b>Now the sons of Eli were worthless men. They did not know the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v09002013-1">13&nbsp;</b>The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand, <b class="verse-num" id="v09002014-1">14&nbsp;</b>and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there. <b class="verse-num" id="v09002015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give meat for the priest to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you but only raw.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09002016-1">16&nbsp;</b>And if the man said to him, “Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish,” he would say, “No, you must give it now, and if not, I will take it by force.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09002017-1">17&nbsp;</b>Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the LORD, for the men treated the offering of the LORD with contempt.</p>
<p id="p09002017_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09002018-1">18&nbsp;</b>Samuel was ministering before the LORD, a boy clothed with a linen ephod. <b class="verse-num" id="v09002019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. <b class="verse-num" id="v09002020-1">20&nbsp;</b>Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, “May the LORD give you children by this woman for the petition she asked of the LORD.” So then they would return to their home.</p>
<p id="p09002020_15-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09002021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Indeed the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew in the presence of the LORD.</p>

<p id="p09002021_19-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09002022-1">22&nbsp;</b>Now Eli was very old, and he kept hearing all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who were serving at the entrance to the tent of meeting. <b class="verse-num" id="v09002023-1">23&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people. <b class="verse-num" id="v09002024-1">24&nbsp;</b>No, my sons; it is no good report that I hear the people of the LORD spreading abroad. <b class="verse-num" id="v09002025-1">25&nbsp;</b>If someone sins against a man, God will mediate for him, but if someone sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?” But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for it was the will of the LORD to put them to death.</p>
<p id="p09002025_19-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09002026-1">26&nbsp;</b>Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and also with man.</p>

<p id="p09003001_28-1" class="starts-chapter"><b class="chapter-num" id="v09003001-1">3&nbsp;</b>Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the LORD in the presence of Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.</p>
<p id="p09003001_28-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09003002-1">2&nbsp;</b>At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place. <b class="verse-num" id="v09003003-1">3&nbsp;</b>The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was.</p>
<p id="p09003003_28-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09003004-1">4&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD called Samuel, and he said, “Here I am!” <b class="verse-num" id="v09003005-1">5&nbsp;</b>and ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call; lie down again.” So he went and lay down.</p>
<p id="p09003005_28-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09003006-1">6&nbsp;</b>And the LORD called again, “Samuel!” and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09003007-1">7&nbsp;</b>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.</p>
<p id="p09003007_28-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09003008-1">8&nbsp;</b>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the boy. <b class="verse-num" id="v09003009-1">9&nbsp;</b>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak, LORD, for your servant hears.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p>
<p id="p09003009_28-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09003010-1">10&nbsp;</b>And the LORD came and stood, calling as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant hears.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09003011-1">11&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD said to Samuel, “Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which the two ears of everyone who hears it will tingle. <b class="verse-num" id="v09003012-1">12&nbsp;</b>On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. <b class="verse-num" id="v09003013-1">13&nbsp;</b>And I declare to him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f10-1" id="fb10-1" title="&lt;note class=&quot;alternative&quot;&gt;Or &lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;catch-word&quot;&gt;blaspheming&lt;/span&gt; for themselves&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;">10</a></sup> and he did not restrain them. <b class="verse-num" id="v09003014-1">14&nbsp;</b>Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.”</p>
<p id="p09003014_28-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09003015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli. <b class="verse-num" id="v09003016-1">16&nbsp;</b>But Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he said, “Here I am.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09003017-1">17&nbsp;</b>And Eli said, “What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also if you hide anything from me of all that he told you.” <b class="verse-num" id="v09003018-1">18&nbsp;</b>So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, “It is the LORD. Let him do what seems good to him.”</p>
<p id="p09003018_28-1"><b class="verse-num" id="v09003019-1">19&nbsp;</b>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground. <b class="verse-num" id="v09003020-1">20&nbsp;</b>And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the LORD. <b class="verse-num" id="v09003021-1">21&nbsp;</b>And the LORD appeared again at Shiloh, for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</p>
